{"instruction": "Introduction", "input": "", "output": "This Ecma Standard defines the ECMAScript 2026 Language. It is the seventeenth edition of the ECMAScript Language Specification. Since publication of the first edition in 1997, ECMAScript has grown to be one of the world's most widely used general-purpose programming languages. It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications.\n\nECMAScript is based on several originating technologies, the most well-known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company's Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0.\n\nThe development of the ECMAScript Language Specification started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.\n\nThat Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in nature.\n\nThe third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of future language growth. The third edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June 2002.\n\nAfter publication of the third edition, ECMAScript achieved massive adoption in conjunction with the World Wide Web where it has become the programming language that is supported by essentially all web browsers. Significant work was done to develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript. However, that work was not completed and not published as the fourth edition of ECMAScript but some of it was incorporated into the development of the sixth edition.\n\nThe fifth edition of ECMAScript (published as ECMA-262 5th edition) codified de facto interpretations of the language specification that have become common among browser implementations and added support for new features that had emerged since the publication of the third edition. Such features include [accessor properties], reflective creation and inspection of objects, program control of property attributes, additional array manipulation functions, support for the JSON object encoding format, and a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security. The fifth edition was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 2009.\n\nThe fifth edition was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262:2011. Edition 5.1 of the ECMAScript Standard incorporated minor corrections and is the same text as ISO/IEC 16262:2011. The 5.1 Edition was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 2011.\n\nFocused development of the sixth edition started in 2009, as the fifth edition was being prepared for publication. However, this was preceded by significant experimentation and language enhancement design efforts dating to the publication of the third edition in 1999. In a very real sense, the completion of the sixth edition is the culmination of a fifteen year effort. The goals for this edition included providing better support for large applications, library creation, and for use of ECMAScript as a compilation target for other languages. Some of its major enhancements included modules, class declarations, lexical block scoping, [iterators] and generators, promises for asynchronous programming, destructuring patterns, and proper tail calls. The ECMAScript library of built-ins was expanded to support additional data abstractions including maps, sets, and arrays of binary numeric values as well as additional support for Unicode supplementary characters in strings and regular expressions. The built-ins were also made extensible via subclassing. The sixth edition provides the foundation for regular, incremental language and library enhancements. The sixth edition was adopted by the General Assembly of June 2015.\n\nECMAScript 2016 was the first ECMAScript edition released under Ecma TC39's new yearly release cadence and open development process. A plain-text source document was built from the ECMAScript 2015 source document to serve as the base for further development entirely on GitHub. Over the year of this standard's development, hundreds of pull requests and issues were filed representing thousands of bug fixes, editorial fixes and other improvements. Additionally, numerous software tools were developed to aid in this effort including Ecmarkup, Ecmarkdown, and Grammarkdown. ES2016 also included support for a new exponentiation operator and adds a new method to `Array.prototype` called `includes`.\n\nECMAScript 2017 introduced Async Functions, Shared Memory, and Atomics along with smaller language and library enhancements, bug fixes, and editorial updates. Async functions improve the asynchronous programming experience by providing syntax for promise-returning functions. Shared Memory and Atomics introduce a new [memory model] that allows multi-[agent] programs to communicate using atomic operations that ensure a well-defined execution order even on parallel CPUs. It also included new static methods on Object: `Object.values`, `Object.entries`, and `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors`.\n\nECMAScript 2018 introduced support for asynchronous iteration via the [async iterator] protocol and async generators. It also included four new regular expression features: the `dotAll` flag, named capture groups, Unicode property escapes, and look-behind assertions. Lastly it included object rest and spread properties.\n\nECMAScript 2019 introduced a few new built-in functions: `flat` and `flatMap` on `Array.prototype` for flattening arrays, `Object.fromEntries` for directly turning the return value of `Object.entries` into a new Object, and `trimStart` and `trimEnd` on `String.prototype` as better-named alternatives to the widely implemented but non-standard `String.prototype.trimLeft` and `trimRight` built-ins. In addition, it included a few minor updates to syntax and semantics. Updated syntax included optional catch binding parameters and allowing U+2028 (LINE SEPARATOR) and U+2029 (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR) in string literals to align with JSON. Other updates included requiring that `Array.prototype.sort` be a stable sort, requiring that `JSON.stringify` return well-formed UTF-8 regardless of input, and clarifying `Function.prototype.toString` by requiring that it either return the corresponding original source text or a standard placeholder.\n\nECMAScript 2020, the 11th edition, introduced the `matchAll` method for Strings, to produce an [iterator] for all match objects generated by a global regular expression; `import()`, a syntax to asynchronously import Modules with a dynamic specifier; `BigInt`, a new number primitive for working with arbitrary precision [integers]; `Promise.allSettled`, a new Promise combinator that does not short-circuit; `globalThis`, a universal way to access the global `this` value; dedicated `export * as ns from 'module'` syntax for use within modules; increased standardization of `for-in` enumeration order; `import.meta`, a [host]-populated object available in Modules that may contain contextual information about the Module; as well as adding two new syntax features to improve working with “nullish” values (undefined or null): nullish coalescing, a value selection operator; and optional chaining, a property access and function invocation operator that short-circuits if the value to access/invoke is nullish.\n\nECMAScript 2021, the 12th edition, introduced the `replaceAll` method for Strings; `Promise.any`, a Promise combinator that short-circuits when an input value is fulfilled; `AggregateError`, a new Error type to represent multiple errors at once; logical assignment operators (`??=`, `&&=`, `||=`); `WeakRef`, for referring to a target object without preserving it from garbage collection, and `FinalizationRegistry`, to manage registration and unregistration of cleanup operations performed when target objects are garbage collected; separators for numeric literals (`1_000`); and `Array.prototype.sort` was made more precise, reducing the amount of cases that result in an [implementation-defined] [sort order].\n\nECMAScript 2022, the 13th edition, introduced top-level `await`, allowing the [keyword] to be used at the top level of modules; new class elements: public and private instance fields, public and private static fields, private instance methods and accessors, and private static methods and accessors; static blocks inside classes, to perform per-class evaluation initialization; the `#x in obj` syntax, to test for presence of private fields on objects; regular expression match indices via the `/d` flag, which provides start and end indices for matched substrings; the `cause` property on `Error` objects, which can be used to record a causation chain in errors; the `at` method for Strings, Arrays, and [TypedArrays], which allows relative indexing; and `Object.hasOwn`, a convenient alternative to `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`.\n\nECMAScript 2023, the 14th edition, introduced the `toSorted`, `toReversed`, `with`, `findLast`, and `findLastIndex` methods on `Array.prototype` and `TypedArray.prototype`, as well as the `toSpliced` method on `Array.prototype`; added support for `#!` comments at the beginning of files to better facilitate executable ECMAScript files; and allowed the use of most Symbols as keys in weak collections.\n\nECMAScript 2024, the 15th edition, added facilities for resizing and transferring ArrayBuffers and SharedArrayBuffers; added a new RegExp `/v` flag for creating RegExps with more advanced features for working with sets of strings; and introduced the `Promise.withResolvers` convenience method for constructing Promises, the `Object.groupBy` and `Map.groupBy` methods for aggregating data, the `Atomics.waitAsync` method for asynchronously waiting for a change to shared memory, and the `String.prototype.isWellFormed` and `String.prototype.toWellFormed` methods for checking and ensuring that strings contain only well-formed Unicode.\n\nECMAScript 2025, the 16th edition, added a new `Iterator` global with associated static and prototype methods for working with [iterators]; added methods to `Set.prototype` for performing common operations on Sets; added support for importing JSON modules as well as syntax for declaring attributes of imported modules; added the `RegExp.escape` method for escaping a string to be safely used in a regular expression; added syntax for enabling and disabling modifier flags inline within regular expressions; added the `Promise.try` method for calling functions which may or may not return a `Promise` and ensuring the result is always a `Promise`; and added a new `Float16Array` [TypedArray] kind as well as the related `DataView.prototype.getFloat16`, `DataView.prototype.setFloat16`, and `Math.f16round` methods.\n\nDozens of individuals representing many organizations have made very significant contributions within Ecma TC39 to the development of this edition and to the prior editions. In addition, a vibrant community has emerged supporting TC39's ECMAScript efforts. This community has reviewed numerous drafts, filed thousands of bug reports, performed implementation experiments, contributed test suites, and educated the world-wide developer community about ECMAScript. Unfortunately, it is impossible to identify and acknowledge every person and organization who has contributed to this effort.\n\nAllen Wirfs-Brock  \nECMA-262, Project Editor, 6th Edition\n\nBrian Terlson  \nECMA-262, Project Editor, 7th through 10th Editions\n\nJordan Harband  \nECMA-262, Project Editor, 10th through 12th Editions\n\nShu-yu Guo  \nECMA-262, Project Editor, 12th through 16th Editions\n\nMichael Ficarra  \nECMA-262, Project Editor, 12th through 16th Editions\n\nKevin Gibbons  \nECMA-262, Project Editor, 12th through 16th Editions"}

{"instruction": "4 Overview", "input": "", "output": "This section contains a non-normative overview of the ECMAScript language.\n\nECMAScript is an object-oriented programming language for performing computations and manipulating computational objects within a [host environment]. ECMAScript as defined here is not intended to be computationally self-sufficient; indeed, there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results. Instead, it is expected that the computational environment of an ECMAScript program will provide not only the objects and other facilities described in this specification but also certain environment-specific objects, whose description and behaviour are beyond the scope of this specification except to indicate that they may provide certain properties that can be accessed and certain functions that can be called from an ECMAScript program.\n\nECMAScript was originally designed to be used as a scripting language, but has become widely used as a general-purpose programming language. A _scripting language_ is a programming language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system. In such systems, useful functionality is already available through a user interface, and the scripting language is a mechanism for exposing that functionality to program control. In this way, the existing system is said to provide a [host environment] of objects and facilities, which completes the capabilities of the scripting language. A scripting language is intended for use by both professional and non-professional programmers.\n\nECMAScript was originally designed to be a _Web scripting language_, providing a mechanism to enliven Web pages in browsers and to perform server computation as part of a Web-based client-server architecture. ECMAScript is now used to provide core scripting capabilities for a variety of [host environments]. Therefore the core language is specified in this document apart from any particular [host environment].\n\nECMAScript usage has moved beyond simple scripting and it is now used for the full spectrum of programming tasks in many different environments and scales. As the usage of ECMAScript has expanded, so have the features and facilities it provides. ECMAScript is now a fully featured general-purpose programming language."}
{"instruction": "4.1 Web Scripting", "input": "", "output": "A web browser provides an ECMAScript [host environment] for client-side computation including, for instance, objects that represent windows, menus, pop-ups, dialog boxes, text areas, anchors, frames, history, cookies, and input/output. Further, the [host environment] provides a means to attach scripting code to events such as change of focus, page and image loading, unloading, error and abort, selection, form submission, and mouse actions. Scripting code appears within the HTML and the displayed page is a combination of user interface elements and fixed and computed text and images. The scripting code is reactive to user interaction, and there is no need for a main program.\n\nA web server provides a different [host environment] for server-side computation including objects representing requests, clients, and files; and mechanisms to lock and share data. By using browser-side and server-side scripting together, it is possible to distribute computation between the client and server while providing a customized user interface for a Web-based application.\n\nEach Web browser and server that supports ECMAScript supplies its own [host environment], completing the ECMAScript execution environment."}
{"instruction": "4.2 Hosts and Implementations", "input": "", "output": "To aid integrating ECMAScript into [host environments], this specification defers the definition of certain facilities (e.g., [abstract operations]), either in whole or in part, to a source outside of this specification. Editorially, this specification distinguishes the following kinds of deferrals.\n\nAn _implementation_ is an external source that further defines facilities enumerated in Annex [D] or those that are marked as [implementation-defined] or [implementation-approximated]. In informal use, an implementation refers to a concrete artefact, such as a particular web browser.\n\nAn implementation-defined facility is one that defers its definition to an external source without further qualification. This specification does not make any recommendations for particular behaviours, and conforming implementations are free to choose any behaviour within the constraints put forth by this specification.\n\nAn implementation-approximated facility is one that defers its definition to an external source while recommending an ideal behaviour. While conforming implementations are free to choose any behaviour within the constraints put forth by this specification, they are encouraged to strive to approximate the ideal. Some mathematical operations, such as [`Math.exp`], are [implementation-approximated].\n\nA host is an external source that further defines facilities listed in Annex [D] but does not further define other [implementation-defined] or [implementation-approximated] facilities. In informal use, a [host] refers to the set of all implementations, such as the set of all web browsers, that interface with this specification in the same way via Annex [D]. A [host] is often an external specification, such as WHATWG HTML ([https://html.spec.whatwg.org/](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)). In other words, facilities that are [host-defined] are often further defined in external specifications.\n\nA host hook is an abstract operation that is defined in whole or in part by an external source. All [host hooks] must be listed in Annex [D]. A [host hook] must conform to at least the following requirements:\n\n* It must return either a [normal completion] or a [throw completion].\n\nA host-defined facility is one that defers its definition to an external source without further qualification and is listed in Annex [D]. Implementations that are not [hosts] may also provide definitions for [host-defined] facilities.\n\nA host environment is a particular choice of definition for all [host-defined] facilities. A [host environment] typically includes objects or functions which allow obtaining input and providing output as [host-defined] properties of the [global object].\n\nThis specification follows the editorial convention of always using the most specific term. For example, if a facility is [host-defined], it should not be referred to as [implementation-defined].\n\nBoth [hosts] and implementations may interface with this specification via the language types, specification types, [abstract operations], grammar productions, intrinsic objects, and intrinsic symbols defined herein."}
{"instruction": "4.3 ECMAScript Overview", "input": "", "output": "The following is an informal overview of ECMAScript—not all parts of the language are described. This overview is not part of the standard proper.\n\nECMAScript is object-based: basic language and [host] facilities are provided by objects, and an ECMAScript program is a cluster of communicating objects. In ECMAScript, an _object_ is a collection of zero or more _properties_ each with _attributes_ that determine how each property can be used—for example, when the Writable attribute for a property is set to false, any attempt by executed ECMAScript code to assign a different value to the property fails. Properties are containers that hold other objects, _primitive values_, or _functions_. A primitive value is a member of one of the following built-in types: **Undefined**, **Null**, **Boolean**, **Number**, **BigInt**, **String**, and **Symbol;** an object is a member of the built-in type **Object**; and a function is a callable object. A function that is associated with an object via a property is called a _method_.\n\nECMAScript defines a collection of _built-in objects_ that round out the definition of ECMAScript entities. These built-in objects include the [global object]; objects that are fundamental to the [runtime semantics] of the language including `Object`, `Function`, `Boolean`, `Symbol`, and various `Error` objects; objects that represent and manipulate numeric values including `Math`, `Number`, and `Date`; the text processing objects `String` and `RegExp`; objects that are indexed collections of values including `Array` and nine different kinds of Typed Arrays whose elements all have a specific numeric data representation; keyed collections including `Map` and `Set` objects; objects supporting structured data including the `JSON` object, `ArrayBuffer`, `SharedArrayBuffer`, and `DataView`; objects supporting control abstractions including generator functions and `Promise` objects; and reflection objects including `Proxy` and `Reflect`.\n\nECMAScript also defines a set of built-in _operators_. ECMAScript operators include various unary operations, multiplicative operators, additive operators, bitwise shift operators, relational operators, equality operators, binary bitwise operators, binary logical operators, assignment operators, and the comma operator.\n\nLarge ECMAScript programs are supported by _modules_ which allow a program to be divided into multiple sequences of statements and declarations. Each module explicitly identifies declarations it uses that need to be provided by other modules and which of its declarations are available for use by other modules.\n\nECMAScript syntax intentionally resembles Java syntax. ECMAScript syntax is relaxed to enable it to serve as an easy-to-use scripting language. For example, a variable is not required to have its type declared nor are types associated with properties, and defined functions are not required to have their declarations appear textually before calls to them."}
{"instruction": "4.3.1 Objects", "input": "", "output": "Even though ECMAScript includes syntax for class definitions, ECMAScript objects are not fundamentally class-based such as those in C++, Smalltalk, or Java. Instead objects may be created in various ways including via a literal notation or via _[constructors]_ which create objects and then execute code that initializes all or part of them by assigning initial values to their properties. Each [constructor] is a function that has a property named \"prototype\" that is used to implement _prototype-based inheritance_ and _shared properties_. Objects are created by using [constructors] in **new** expressions; for example, `new Date(2009, 11)` creates a new Date object. Invoking a [constructor] without using **new** has consequences that depend on the [constructor]. For example, `Date()` produces a string representation of the current date and time rather than an object.\n\nEvery object created by a [constructor] has an implicit reference (called the object's _prototype_) to the value of its [constructor]'s \"prototype\" property. Furthermore, a prototype may have a non-null implicit reference to its prototype, and so on; this is called the _prototype chain_. When a reference is made to a property in an object, that reference is to the property of that name in the first object in the prototype chain that contains a property of that name. In other words, first the object mentioned directly is examined for such a property; if that object contains the named property, that is the property to which the reference refers; if that object does not contain the named property, the prototype for that object is examined next; and so on.\n\nFigure 1: Object/Prototype Relationships\n\n![An image of lots of boxes and arrows.](img/figure-1.svg)\n\nIn a class-based object-oriented language, in general, state is carried by instances, methods are carried by classes, and inheritance is only of structure and behaviour. In ECMAScript, the state and methods are carried by objects, while structure, behaviour, and state are all inherited.\n\nAll objects that do not directly contain a particular property that their prototype contains share that property and its value. Figure 1 illustrates this:\n\n**CF** is a [constructor] (and also an object). Five objects have been created by using `new` expressions: **cf1**, **cf2**, **cf3**, **cf4**, and **cf5**. Each of these objects contains properties named \"q1\" and \"q2\". The dashed lines represent the implicit prototype relationship; so, for example, **cf3**'s prototype is **CFp**. The [constructor], **CF**, has two properties itself, named \"P1\" and \"P2\", which are not visible to **CFp**, **cf1**, **cf2**, **cf3**, **cf4**, or **cf5**. The property named \"CFP1\" in **CFp** is shared by **cf1**, **cf2**, **cf3**, **cf4**, and **cf5** (but not by **CF**), as are any properties found in **CFp**'s implicit prototype chain that are not named \"q1\", \"q2\", or \"CFP1\". Notice that there is no implicit prototype link between **CF** and **CFp**.\n\nUnlike most class-based object languages, properties can be added to objects dynamically by assigning values to them. That is, [constructors] are not required to name or assign values to all or any of the constructed object's properties. In the above diagram, one could add a new shared property for **cf1**, **cf2**, **cf3**, **cf4**, and **cf5** by assigning a new value to the property in **CFp**.\n\nAlthough ECMAScript objects are not inherently class-based, it is often convenient to define class-like abstractions based upon a common pattern of [constructor] functions, prototype objects, and methods. The ECMAScript built-in objects themselves follow such a class-like pattern. Beginning with ECMAScript 2015, the ECMAScript language includes syntactic class definitions that permit programmers to concisely define objects that conform to the same class-like abstraction pattern used by the built-in objects."}
{"instruction": "4.3.2 The Strict Variant of ECMAScript", "input": "", "output": "The ECMAScript Language recognizes the possibility that some users of the language may wish to restrict their usage of some features available in the language. They might do so in the interests of security, to avoid what they consider to be error-prone features, to get enhanced error checking, or for other reasons of their choosing. In support of this possibility, ECMAScript defines a strict variant of the language. The strict variant of the language excludes some specific syntactic and semantic features of the regular ECMAScript language and modifies the detailed semantics of some features. The strict variant also specifies additional error conditions that must be reported by throwing error exceptions in situations that are not specified as errors by the non-strict form of the language.\n\nThe strict variant of ECMAScript is commonly referred to as the _strict mode_ of the language. Strict mode selection and use of the strict mode syntax and semantics of ECMAScript is explicitly made at the level of individual [ECMAScript source text] units as described in [11.2.2]. Because strict mode is selected at the level of a syntactic source text unit, strict mode only imposes restrictions that have local effect within such a source text unit. Strict mode does not restrict or modify any aspect of the ECMAScript semantics that must operate consistently across multiple source text units. A complete ECMAScript program may be composed of both strict mode and non-strict mode [ECMAScript source text] units. In this case, strict mode only applies when actually executing code that is defined within a strict mode source text unit.\n\nIn order to conform to this specification, an ECMAScript implementation must implement both the full unrestricted ECMAScript language and the strict variant of the ECMAScript language as defined by this specification. In addition, an implementation must support the combination of unrestricted and strict mode source text units into a single composite program."}

They include the definitions of all of the standard objects that are available for use by ECMAScript programs as they execute.\n\nClause [29] describes the memory consistency model of accesses on SharedArrayBuffer-backed memory and methods of the Atomics object."}
{"instruction": "5.1.1 Context-Free Grammars", "input": "", "output": "A _context-free grammar_ consists of a number of _productions_. Each production has an abstract symbol called a _nonterminal_ as its _left-hand side_, and a sequence of zero or more nonterminal and _terminal_ symbols as its _right-hand side_. For each grammar, the terminal symbols are drawn from a specified alphabet.\n\nA chain production is a production that has exactly one nonterminal symbol on its right-hand side along with zero or more terminal symbols.\n\nStarting from a sentence consisting of a single distinguished nonterminal, called the goal symbol, a given context-free grammar specifies a _language_, namely, the (perhaps infinite) set of possible sequences of terminal symbols that can result from repeatedly replacing any nonterminal in the sequence with a right-hand side of a production for which the nonterminal is the left-hand side."}
{"instruction": "5.1.2 The Lexical and RegExp Grammars", "input": "", "output": "A _lexical grammar_ for ECMAScript is given in clause [12]. This grammar has as its terminal symbols Unicode code points that conform to the rules for [SourceCharacter] defined in [11.1]. It defines a set of productions, starting from the [goal symbol] [InputElementDiv], [InputElementTemplateTail], [InputElementRegExp], [InputElementRegExpOrTemplateTail], or [InputElementHashbangOrRegExp], that describe how sequences of such code points are translated into a sequence of input elements.\n\nInput elements other than white space and comments form the terminal symbols for the syntactic grammar for ECMAScript and are called ECMAScript _tokens_. These tokens are the [reserved words], identifiers, literals, and punctuators of the ECMAScript language. Moreover, line terminators, although not considered to be tokens, also become part of the stream of input elements and guide the process of automatic semicolon insertion ([12.10]). Simple white space and single-line comments are discarded and do not appear in the stream of input elements for the syntactic grammar. A [MultiLineComment] (that is, a comment of the form `/*`…`*/` regardless of whether it spans more than one line) is likewise simply discarded if it contains no line terminator; but if a [MultiLineComment] contains one or more line terminators, then it is replaced by a single line terminator, which becomes part of the stream of input elements for the syntactic grammar.\n\nA _RegExp grammar_ for ECMAScript is given in [22.2.1]. This grammar also has as its terminal symbols the code points as defined by [SourceCharacter]. It defines a set of productions, starting from the [goal symbol] [Pattern], that describe how sequences of code points are translated into regular expression patterns.\n\nProductions of the lexical and RegExp grammars are distinguished by having two colons “**::**” as separating punctuation. The lexical and RegExp grammars share some productions."}

It has as its terminal symbols [SourceCharacter], and is used for translating Strings into numeric values starting from the [goal symbol] [StringNumericLiteral] (which is similar to but distinct from the [lexical grammar for numeric literals]).\n\nProductions of the numeric string grammar are distinguished by having three colons “**:::**” as punctuation, and are never used for parsing source text."}
{"instruction": "5.1.4 The Syntactic Grammar", "input": "", "output": "The _syntactic grammar_ for ECMAScript is given in clauses [13] through [16]. This grammar has ECMAScript tokens defined by the lexical grammar as its terminal symbols ([5.1.2]). It defines a set of productions, starting from two alternative [goal symbols] [Script] and [Module], that describe how sequences of tokens form syntactically correct independent components of ECMAScript programs.\n\nWhen a stream of code points is to be parsed as an ECMAScript [Script] or [Module], it is first converted to a stream of input elements by repeated application of the lexical grammar; this stream of input elements is then parsed by a single application of the syntactic grammar. The input stream is syntactically in error if the tokens in the stream of input elements cannot be parsed as a single instance of the goal nonterminal ([Script] or [Module]), with no tokens left over.\n\nWhen a parse is successful, it constructs a _parse tree_, a rooted tree structure in which each node is a Parse Node. Each Parse Node is an _instance_ of a symbol in the grammar; it represents a span of the source text that can be derived from that symbol. The root node of the parse tree, representing the whole of the source text, is an instance of the parse's [goal symbol]. When a Parse Node is an instance of a nonterminal, it is also an instance of some production that has that nonterminal as its left-hand side. Moreover, it has zero or more _children_, one for each symbol on the production's right-hand side: each child is a Parse Node that is an instance of the corresponding symbol.\n\nNew Parse Nodes are instantiated for each invocation of the parser and never reused between parses even of identical source text. Parse Nodes are considered the same Parse Node if and only if they represent the same span of source text, are instances of the same grammar symbol, and resulted from the same parser invocation.\n\nNote 1\n\nParsing the same String multiple times will lead to different Parse Nodes. For example, consider:\n\n    let str = \"1 + 1;\";\n    eval(str);\n    eval(str);\n\nEach call to `eval` converts the value of `str` into [ECMAScript source text] and performs an independent parse that creates its own separate tree of Parse Nodes. The trees are distinct even though each parse operates upon a source text that was derived from the same String value.\n\nNote 2\n\nParse Nodes are specification artefacts, and implementations are not required to use an analogous data structure.\n\nProductions of the syntactic grammar are distinguished by having just one colon “**:**” as punctuation.\n\nThe syntactic grammar as presented in clauses [13] through [16] is not a complete account of which token sequences are accepted as a correct ECMAScript [Script] or [Module]. Certain additional token sequences are also accepted, namely, those that would be described by the grammar if only semicolons were added to the sequence in certain places (such as before line terminator characters). Furthermore, certain token sequences that are described by the grammar are not considered acceptable if a line terminator character appears in certain “awkward” places.\n\nIn certain cases, in order to avoid ambiguities, the syntactic grammar uses generalized productions that permit token sequences that do not form a valid ECMAScript [Script] or [Module]. For example, this technique is used for object literals and object destructuring patterns. In such cases a more restrictive _supplemental grammar_ is provided that further restricts the acceptable token sequences. Typically, an [early error] rule will then state that, in certain contexts, \"P must cover an N\", where P is a Parse Node (an instance of the generalized production) and N is a nonterminal from the supplemental grammar. This means:\n\n1.  The sequence of tokens originally matched by P is parsed again using N as the [goal symbol]. If N takes grammatical parameters, then they are set to the same values used when P was originally parsed.\n2.  If the sequence of tokens can be parsed as a single instance of N, with no tokens left over, then:\n    1.  We refer to that instance of N (a Parse Node, unique for a given P) as \"the N that is covered by P\".\n    2.  All Early Error rules for N and its derived productions also apply to the N that is covered by P.\n3.  Otherwise (if the parse fails), it is an early Syntax Error."}
{"instruction": "5.1.5.1 Terminal Symbols", "input": "", "output": "In the ECMAScript grammars, some terminal symbols are shown in `fixed-width` font. These are to appear in a source text exactly as written. All terminal symbol code points specified in this way are to be understood as the appropriate Unicode code points from the Basic Latin block, as opposed to any similar-looking code points from other Unicode ranges. A code point in a terminal symbol cannot be expressed by a `\\` [UnicodeEscapeSequence].\n\nIn grammars whose terminal symbols are individual Unicode code points (i.e., the lexical, RegExp, and numeric string grammars), a contiguous run of multiple fixed-width code points appearing in a production is a simple shorthand for the same sequence of code points, written as standalone terminal symbols.\n\nFor example, the production:\n\n[HexIntegerLiteral] :: 0x [HexDigits]\n\nis a shorthand for:\n\n[HexIntegerLiteral] :: 0 x [HexDigits]\n\nIn contrast, in the syntactic grammar, a contiguous run of fixed-width code points is a single terminal symbol.\n\nTerminal symbols come in two other forms:\n\n* In the lexical and RegExp grammars, Unicode code points without a conventional printed representation are instead shown in the form \"&lt;ABBREV&gt;\" where \"ABBREV\" is a mnemonic for the code point or set of code points. These forms are defined in [Unicode Format-Control Characters], [White Space], and [Line Terminators].\n* In the syntactic grammar, certain terminal symbols (e.g. [IdentifierName] and [RegularExpressionLiteral]) are shown in italics, as they refer to the nonterminals of the same name in the lexical grammar."}
{"instruction": "5.1.5.2 Nonterminal Symbols and Productions", "input": "", "output": "Nonterminal symbols are shown in _italic_ type.

(The number of colons indicates to which grammar the production belongs.) One or more alternative right-hand sides for the nonterminal then follow on succeeding lines. For example, the syntactic definition:\n\n[WhileStatement] : while ( [Expression] ) [Statement]\n\nstates that the nonterminal [WhileStatement] represents the token `while`, followed by a left parenthesis token, followed by an [Expression], followed by a right parenthesis token, followed by a [Statement]. The occurrences of [Expression] and [Statement] are themselves nonterminals. As another example, the syntactic definition:\n\n[ArgumentList] : [AssignmentExpression] [ArgumentList] , [AssignmentExpression]\n\nstates that an [ArgumentList] may represent either a single [AssignmentExpression] or an [ArgumentList], followed by a comma, followed by an [AssignmentExpression]. This definition of [ArgumentList] is recursive, that is, it is defined in terms of itself. The result is that an [ArgumentList] may contain any positive number of arguments, separated by commas, where each argument expression is an [AssignmentExpression]. Such recursive definitions of nonterminals are common."}

For example:\n\n[VariableDeclaration]\\[In\\] : [BindingIdentifier] [Initializer]\\[?In\\]\n\nis an abbreviation for:\n\n[VariableDeclaration] : [BindingIdentifier] [Initializer] [VariableDeclaration_In] : [BindingIdentifier] Initializer_In\n\nIf a right-hand side alternative is prefixed with “\\[+parameter\\]” that alternative is only available if the named parameter was used in referencing the production's nonterminal symbol.

Similarly, “\\[lookahead ∈ set\\]”, where set is a [finite] non-empty set of token sequences, indicates that the production may only be used if some element of set is a prefix of the immediately following token sequence. For convenience, the set can also be written as a nonterminal, in which case it represents the set of all token sequences to which that nonterminal could expand. It is considered an editorial error if the nonterminal could expand to infinitely many distinct token sequences.\n\nThese conditions may be negated. “\\[lookahead ≠ seq\\]” indicates that the containing production may only be used if seq is _not_ a prefix of the immediately following input token sequence, and “\\[lookahead ∉ set\\]” indicates that the production may only be used if _no_ element of set is a prefix of the immediately following token sequence.\n\nAs an example, given the definitions:\n\n[DecimalDigit] :: one of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 [DecimalDigits] :: [DecimalDigit] [DecimalDigits] [DecimalDigit]\n\nthe definition:\n\n[LookaheadExample] :: n \\[lookahead ∉ { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 }\\] [DecimalDigits] [DecimalDigit] \\[lookahead ∉ [DecimalDigit]\\]\n\nmatches either the letter `n` followed by one or more decimal digits the first of which is even, or a decimal digit not followed by another decimal digit.\n\nNote that when these phrases are used in the syntactic grammar, it may not be possible to unambiguously identify the immediately following token sequence because determining later tokens requires knowing which lexical [goal symbol] to use at later positions. As such, when these are used in the syntactic grammar, it is considered an editorial error for a token sequence seq to appear in a lookahead restriction (including as part of a set of sequences) if the choices of lexical [goal symbols] to use could change whether or not seq would be a prefix of the resulting token sequence."}

{"instruction": "5.2 Algorithm Conventions", "input": "", "output": "The specification often uses a numbered list to specify steps in an algorithm. These algorithms are used to precisely specify the required semantics of ECMAScript language constructs. The algorithms are not intended to imply the use of any specific implementation technique. In practice, there may be more efficient algorithms available to implement a given feature.\n\nAlgorithms may be explicitly parameterized with an ordered, comma-separated sequence of alias names which may be used within the algorithm steps to reference the argument passed in that position. Optional parameters are denoted with surrounding brackets (\\[ , name \\]) and are no different from required parameters within algorithm steps. A rest parameter may appear at the end of a parameter list, denoted with leading ellipsis (, ...name). The rest parameter captures all of the arguments provided following the required and optional parameters into a [List]. If there are no such additional arguments, that [List] is empty.\n\nAlgorithm steps may be subdivided into sequential substeps. Substeps are indented and may themselves be further divided into indented substeps. Outline numbering conventions are used to identify substeps with the first level of substeps labelled with lowercase alphabetic characters and the second level of substeps labelled with lowercase roman numerals. If more than three levels are required these rules repeat with the fourth level using numeric labels. For example:\n\n1.  Top-level step\n    1.  Substep.\n    2.  Substep.\n        1.  Subsubstep.\n            1.  Subsubsubstep\n                1.  Subsubsubsubstep\n                    1.  Subsubsubsubsubstep\n\nA step or substep may be written as an “if” predicate that conditions its substeps. In this case, the substeps are only applied if the predicate is true. If a step or substep begins with the word “else”, it is a predicate that is the negation of the preceding “if” predicate step at the same level.\n\nA step may specify the iterative application of its substeps.\n\nA step that begins with “Assert:” asserts an invariant condition of its algorithm. Such assertions are used to make explicit algorithmic invariants that would otherwise be implicit. Such assertions add no additional semantic requirements and hence need not be checked by an implementation. They are used simply to clarify algorithms.\n\nAlgorithm steps may declare named aliases for any value using the form “Let x be someValue”. These aliases are reference-like in that both x and someValue refer to the same underlying data and modifications to either are visible to both. Algorithm steps that want to avoid this reference-like behaviour should explicitly make a copy of the right-hand side: “Let x be a copy of someValue” creates a shallow copy of someValue.\n\nOnce declared, an alias may be referenced in any subsequent steps and must not be referenced from steps prior to the alias's declaration. Aliases may be modified using the form “Set x to someOtherValue”."}

A production that has multiple alternative definitions will typically have a distinct algorithm for each alternative. When an algorithm is associated with a grammar production, it may reference the terminal and nonterminal symbols of the production alternative as if they were parameters of the algorithm. When used in this manner, nonterminal symbols refer to the actual alternative definition that is matched when parsing the source text. The source text matched by a grammar production or [Parse Node] derived from it is the portion of the source text that starts at the beginning of the first terminal that participated in the match and ends at the end of the last terminal that participated in the match.\n\nWhen an algorithm is associated with a production alternative, the alternative is typically shown without any “\\[ \\]” grammar annotations. Such annotations should only affect the syntactic recognition of the alternative and have no effect on the associated semantics for the alternative.\n\nSyntax-directed operations are invoked with a parse node and, optionally, other parameters by using the conventions on steps [1], [3], and [4] in the following algorithm:\n\n1.  Let status be SyntaxDirectedOperation of SomeNonTerminal.\n2.  Let someParseNode be the parse of some source text.\n3.  Perform SyntaxDirectedOperation of someParseNode.\n4.

{"instruction": "5.2.5 Mathematical Operations", "input": "", "output": "This specification makes reference to these kinds of numeric values:\n\n* Mathematical values: Arbitrary real numbers, used as the default numeric type.\n* Extended mathematical values: [Mathematical values] together with +∞ and -∞.\n* _Numbers_: [IEEE 754-2019] binary64 (double-precision floating point) values.\n* _BigInts_: [ECMAScript language values] representing arbitrary [integers] in a one-to-one correspondence.\n\nIn the language of this specification, numerical values are distinguished among different numeric kinds using subscript suffixes. The subscript 𝔽 refers to Numbers, and the subscript ℤ refers to BigInts. Numeric values without a subscript suffix refer to [mathematical values]. This specification denotes most numeric values in base 10; it also uses numeric values of the form 0x followed by digits 0-9 or A-F as base-16 values.\n\nIn general, when this specification refers to a numerical value, such as in the phrase, \"the length of y\" or \"the [integer] represented by the four hexadecimal digits ...\", without explicitly specifying a numeric kind, the phrase refers to a [mathematical value]. Phrases which refer to a Number or a BigInt value are explicitly annotated as such; for example, \"the [Number value for] the number of code points in …\" or \"the [BigInt value for] …\".\n\nWhen the term integer is used in this specification, it refers to a [mathematical value] which is in the set of [integers], unless otherwise stated. When the term integral Number is used in this specification, it refers to a [finite] Number value whose [mathematical value] is in the set of [integers].\n\nNumeric operators such as +, ×, =, and ≥ refer to those operations as determined by the type of the operands. When applied to [mathematical values], the operators refer to the usual mathematical operations. When applied to [extended mathematical values], the operators refer to the usual mathematical operations over the extended real numbers; indeterminate forms are not defined and their use in this specification should be considered an editorial error. When applied to Numbers, the operators refer to the relevant operations within [IEEE 754-2019]. When applied to BigInts, the operators refer to the usual mathematical operations applied to the [mathematical value of] the BigInt. Numeric operators applied to mixed-type operands (such as a Number and a [mathematical value]) are not defined and should be considered an editorial error in this specification.\n\nConversions between [mathematical values] and Numbers or BigInts are always explicit in this document. A conversion from a [mathematical value] or [extended mathematical value] x to a Number is denoted as \"the [Number value for] x\" or 𝔽(x), and is defined in [6.1.6.1]. A conversion from an [integer] x to a BigInt is denoted as \"the BigInt value for x\" or ℤ(x). A conversion from a Number or BigInt x to a [mathematical value] is denoted as \"the mathematical value of x\", or ℝ(x). The [mathematical value of] +0𝔽 and -0𝔽 is the [mathematical value] 0\\. The [mathematical value of] non-[finite] values is not defined. The extended mathematical value of x is the [mathematical value of] x for [finite] values, and is +∞ and -∞ for +∞𝔽 and -∞𝔽 respectively; it is not defined for NaN.\n\nThe mathematical function abs(x) produces the absolute value of x, which is -x if x < 0 and otherwise is x itself.\n\nThe mathematical function min(x1, x2, … , xN) produces the mathematically smallest of x1 through xN. The mathematical function max(x1, x2, ..., xN) produces the mathematically largest of x1 through xN. The domain and range of these mathematical functions are the [extended mathematical values].\n\nThe notation “x modulo y” (y must be [finite] and non-zero) computes a value k of the same sign as y (or zero) such that [abs](k) < [abs](y) and x \\- k = q × y for some [integer] q.\n\nThe phrase \"the result of clamping x between lower and upper\" (where x is an [extended mathematical value] and lower and upper are [mathematical values] such that lower ≤ upper) produces lower if x < lower, produces upper if x \\> upper, and otherwise produces x.\n\nThe mathematical function floor(x) produces the largest [integer] (closest to +∞) that is not larger than x.\n\nNote\n\n[floor](x) = x \\- (x [modulo] 1).\n\nThe mathematical function truncate(x) removes the fractional part of x by rounding towards zero, producing -[floor](-x) if x < 0 and otherwise producing [floor](x).\n\nMathematical functions [min], [max], [abs], [floor], and [truncate] are not defined for Numbers and BigInts, and any usage of those methods that have non-[mathematical value] arguments would be an editorial error in this specification.\n\nAn interval from lower bound a to upper bound b is a possibly-infinite, possibly-empty set of numeric values of the same numeric type. Each bound will be described as either inclusive or exclusive, but not both. There are four kinds of intervals, as follows:\n\n* An [interval] from a (inclusive) to b (inclusive), also called an inclusive interval from a to b, includes all values x of the same numeric type such that a ≤ x ≤ b, and no others.\n* An [interval] from a (inclusive) to b (exclusive) includes all values x of the same numeric type such that a ≤ x < b, and no others.\n* An [interval] from a (exclusive) to b (inclusive) includes all values x of the same numeric type such that a < x ≤ b, and no others.\n* An [interval] from a (exclusive) to b (exclusive) includes all values x of the same numeric type such that a < x < b, and no others.\n\nFor example, the [interval] from 1 (inclusive) to 2 (exclusive) consists of all [mathematical values] between 1 and 2, including 1 and not including 2. For the purpose of defining intervals, -0𝔽 < +0𝔽, so, for example, an [inclusive interval] with a lower bound of +0𝔽 includes +0𝔽 but not -0𝔽. NaN is never included in an [interval]."}

{"instruction": "5.2.7 Identity", "input": "", "output": "In this specification, both specification values and [ECMAScript language values] are compared for equality. When comparing for equality, values fall into one of two categories. Values without identity are equal to other values without identity if all of their innate characteristics are the same — characteristics such as the magnitude of an [integer] or the length of a sequence. Values without identity may be manifest without prior reference by fully describing their characteristics. In contrast, each value with identity is unique and therefore only equal to itself. Values with identity are like values without identity but with an additional unguessable, unchangeable, universally-unique characteristic called _identity_. References to existing values with identity cannot be manifest simply by describing them, as the identity itself is indescribable; instead, references to these values must be explicitly passed from one place to another. Some values with identity are mutable and therefore can have their characteristics (except their identity) changed in-place, causing all holders of the value to observe the new characteristics. A value without identity is never equal to a value with identity.\n\nFrom the perspective of this specification, the word “is” is used to compare two values for equality, as in “If bool is true, then ...”, and the word “contains” is used to search for a value inside lists using equality comparisons, as in \"If list contains a [Record] r such that r.[Foo] is true, then ...\". The _specification identity_ of values determines the result of these comparisons and is axiomatic in this specification.\n\nFrom the perspective of the ECMAScript language, language values are compared for equality using the [SameValue] abstract operation and the [abstract operations] it transitively calls. The algorithms of these comparison [abstract operations] determine _language identity_ of [ECMAScript language values].\n\nFor specification values, examples of values without specification identity include, but are not limited to: [mathematical values] and [extended mathematical values]; [ECMAScript source text], [surrogate pairs], [Directive Prologues], etc; UTF-16 code units; Unicode code points; [enums]; [abstract operations], including [syntax-directed operations], [host hooks], etc; and ordered pairs. Examples of specification values with specification identity include, but are not limited to: any kind of [Records], including [Property Descriptors], [PrivateElements], etc; [Parse Nodes]; [Lists]; [Sets] and [Relations]; [Abstract Closures]; [Data Blocks]; [Private Names]; [execution contexts] and [execution context stacks]; [agent signifiers]; and [WaiterList Records].\n\nSpecification identity agrees with language identity for all [ECMAScript language values] except Symbol values produced by [Symbol.for]. The [ECMAScript language values] without specification identity and without language identity are [undefined], [null], [Booleans], [Strings], [Numbers], and [BigInts]. The [ECMAScript language values] with specification identity and language identity are [Symbols] not produced by [Symbol.for] and [Objects]. Symbol values produced by [Symbol.for] have specification identity, but not language identity."}

The String type is generally used to represent textual data in a running ECMAScript program, in which case each element in the String is treated as a UTF-16 code unit value. Each element is regarded as occupying a position within the sequence. These positions are indexed with non-negative [integers]. The first element (if any) is at index 0, the next element (if any) at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements (i.e., 16-bit values) within it. The empty String has length zero and therefore contains no elements.\n\nECMAScript operations that do not interpret String contents apply no further semantics. Operations that do interpret String values treat each element as a single UTF-16 code unit. However, ECMAScript does not restrict the value of or relationships between these code units, so operations that further interpret String contents as sequences of Unicode code points encoded in UTF-16 must account for ill-formed subsequences. Such operations apply special treatment to every code unit with a numeric value in the [inclusive interval] from 0xD800 to 0xDBFF (defined by the Unicode Standard as a leading surrogate, or more formally as a high-surrogate code unit) and every code unit with a numeric value in the [inclusive interval] from 0xDC00 to 0xDFFF (defined as a trailing surrogate, or more formally as a low-surrogate code unit) using the following rules:\n\n* A code unit that is not a [leading surrogate] and not a [trailing surrogate] is interpreted as a code point with the same value.\n* A sequence of two code units, where the first code unit c1 is a [leading surrogate] and the second code unit c2 a [trailing surrogate], is a surrogate pair and is interpreted as a code point with the value (c1 \\- 0xD800) × 0x400 + (c2 \\- 0xDC00) + 0x10000. (See [11.1.3])\n* A code unit that is a [leading surrogate] or [trailing surrogate], but is not part of a [surrogate pair], is interpreted as a code point with the same value.\n\nThe function `String.prototype.normalize` (see [22.1.3.15]) can be used to explicitly normalize a String value. `String.prototype.localeCompare` (see [22.1.3.12]) internally normalizes String values, but no other operations implicitly normalize the strings upon which they operate. Operation results are not language- and/or locale-sensitive unless stated otherwise.\n\nNote\n\nThe rationale behind this design was to keep the implementation of Strings as simple and high-performing as possible. If [ECMAScript source text] is in Normalized Form C, string literals are guaranteed to also be normalized, as long as they do not contain any Unicode escape sequences.\n\nIn this specification, the phrase \"the string-concatenation of A, B, ...\" (where each argument is a String value, a code unit, or a sequence of code units) denotes the String value whose sequence of code units is the concatenation of the code units (in order) of each of the arguments (in order).\n\nThe phrase \"the substring of S from inclusiveStart to exclusiveEnd\" (where S is a String value or a sequence of code units and inclusiveStart and exclusiveEnd are [integers]) denotes the String value consisting of the consecutive code units of S beginning at index inclusiveStart and ending immediately before index exclusiveEnd (which is the empty String when inclusiveStart = exclusiveEnd). If the \"to\" suffix is omitted, the length of S is used as the value of exclusiveEnd.\n\nThe phrase \"the ASCII word characters\" denotes the following String value, which consists solely of every letter and number in the Unicode Basic Latin block along with U+005F (LOW LINE):  \n\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_\".  \nFor historical reasons, it has significance to various algorithms."}

{"instruction": "6.1.6.1 The Number Type", "input": "", "output": "The Number type has exactly 18,437,736,874,454,810,627 (that is, 264 \\- 253 \\+ 3) values, representing the double-precision floating point [IEEE 754-2019] binary64 values as specified in the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, except that the 9,007,199,254,740,990 (that is, 253 \\- 2) distinct NaN values of the IEEE Standard are represented in ECMAScript as a single special NaN value. (Note that the NaN value is produced by the program expression `NaN`.) In some implementations, external code might be able to detect a difference between various NaN values, but such behaviour is [implementation-defined]; to ECMAScript code, all NaN values are indistinguishable from each other.\n\nNote\n\nThe bit pattern that might be observed in an ArrayBuffer (see [25.1]) or a SharedArrayBuffer (see [25.2]) after a Number value has been stored into it is not necessarily the same as the internal representation of that Number value used by the ECMAScript implementation.\n\nThere are two other special values, called positive Infinity and negative Infinity. For brevity, these values are also referred to for expository purposes by the symbols +∞𝔽 and -∞𝔽, respectively. (Note that these two infinite Number values are produced by the program expressions `+Infinity` (or simply `Infinity`) and `-Infinity`.)\n\nThe other 18,437,736,874,454,810,624 (that is, 264 \\- 253) values are called the finite numbers. Half of these are positive numbers and half are negative numbers; for every [finite] positive Number value there is a corresponding negative value having the same magnitude.\n\nNote that there is both a positive zero and a negative zero. For brevity, these values are also referred to for expository purposes by the symbols +0𝔽 and -0𝔽, respectively. (Note that these two different zero Number values are produced by the program expressions `+0` (or simply `0`) and `-0`.)\n\nThe 18,437,736,874,454,810,622 (that is, 264 \\- 253 \\- 2) [finite] non-zero values are of two kinds:\n\n18,428,729,675,200,069,632 (that is, 264 \\- 254) of them are normalized, having the form\n\ns × m × 2e\n\nwhere s is 1 or -1, m is an [integer] in the [interval] from 252 (inclusive) to 253 (exclusive), and e is an [integer] in the [inclusive interval] from -1074 to 971.\n\nThe remaining 9,007,199,254,740,990 (that is, 253 \\- 2) values are denormalized, having the form\n\ns × m × 2e\n\nwhere s is 1 or -1, m is an [integer] in the [interval] from 0 (exclusive) to 252 (exclusive), and e is -1074.\n\nNote that all the positive and negative [integers] whose magnitude is no greater than 253 are representable in the Number type. The [integer] 0 has two representations in the Number type: +0𝔽 and -0𝔽.\n\nA [finite] number has an _odd significand_ if it is non-zero and the [integer] m used to express it (in one of the two forms shown above) is odd. Otherwise, it has an _even significand_.\n\nIn this specification, the phrase “the Number value for x” where x represents an exact real mathematical quantity (which might even be an irrational number such as π) means a Number value chosen in the following manner. Consider the set of all [finite] values of the Number type, with -0𝔽 removed and with two additional values added to it that are not representable in the Number type, namely 21024 (which is +1 × 253 × 2971) and -21024 (which is -1 × 253 × 2971). Choose the member of this set that is closest in value to x. If two values of the set are equally close, then the one with an even significand is chosen; for this purpose, the two extra values 21024 and -21024 are considered to have even significands. Finally, if 21024 was chosen, replace it with +∞𝔽; if -21024 was chosen, replace it with -∞𝔽; if +0𝔽 was chosen, replace it with -0𝔽 if and only if x < 0; any other chosen value is used unchanged. The result is the [Number value for] x. (This procedure corresponds exactly to the behaviour of the [IEEE 754-2019] roundTiesToEven mode.)\n\nThe [Number value for] +∞ is +∞𝔽, and the [Number value for] -∞ is -∞𝔽.\n\nSome ECMAScript operators deal only with [integers] in specific ranges such as the [inclusive interval] from -231 to 231 \\- 1 or the [inclusive interval] from 0 to 216 \\- 1. These operators accept any value of the Number type but first convert each such value to an [integer] value in the expected range.

The accessor functions are used to store or retrieve an [ECMAScript language value] that is associated with the property.\n\nThe properties of an object are uniquely identified using [property keys]. A property key is either a String or a Symbol. All Strings and Symbols, including the empty String, are valid as [property keys]. A property name is a [property key] that [is a String].\n\nAn integer index is a [property name] n such that [CanonicalNumericIndexString](n) returns an [integral Number] in the [inclusive interval] from +0𝔽 to [𝔽](253 \\- 1).

{"instruction": "6.1.7.2 Object Internal Methods and Internal Slots", "input": "", "output": "The actual semantics of objects, in ECMAScript, are specified via algorithms called _internal methods_. Each object in an ECMAScript engine is associated with a set of internal methods that defines its runtime behaviour. These internal methods are not part of the ECMAScript language. They are defined by this specification purely for expository purposes. However, each object within an implementation of ECMAScript must behave as specified by the internal methods associated with it. The exact manner in which this is accomplished is determined by the implementation.\n\nInternal method names are polymorphic. This means that different object values may perform different algorithms when a common internal method name is invoked upon them. That actual object upon which an internal method is invoked is the “target” of the invocation. If, at runtime, the implementation of an algorithm attempts to use an internal method of an object that the object does not support, a TypeError exception is thrown.\n\nInternal slots correspond to internal state that is associated with objects and used by various ECMAScript specification algorithms. Internal slots are not object properties and they are not inherited. Depending upon the specific internal slot specification, such state may consist of values of any [ECMAScript language type] or of specific ECMAScript specification type values. Unless explicitly specified otherwise, internal slots are allocated as part of the process of creating an object and may not be dynamically added to an object. Unless specified otherwise, the initial value of an internal slot is the value undefined. Various algorithms within this specification create objects that have internal slots. However, the ECMAScript language provides no direct way to associate internal slots with an object.\n\nAll objects have an internal slot named [PrivateElements], which is a [List] of [PrivateElements]. This [List] represents the values of the private fields, methods, and accessors for the object. Initially, it is an empty [List].\n\nInternal methods and internal slots are identified within this specification using names enclosed in double square brackets [ ].\n\n[Table 4] summarizes the _essential internal methods_ used by this specification that are applicable to all objects created or manipulated by ECMAScript code. Every object must have algorithms for all of the essential internal methods. However, all objects do not necessarily use the same algorithms for those methods.\n\nAn ordinary object is an object that satisfies all of the following criteria:\n\n* For the internal methods listed in [Table 4], the object uses those defined in [10.1].\n* If the object has a [Call] internal method, it uses either the one defined in [10.2.1] or the one defined in [10.3.1].\n* If the object has a [Construct] internal method, it uses either the one defined in [10.2.2] or the one defined in [10.3.2].\n\nAn exotic object is an object that is not an [ordinary object].\n\nThis specification recognizes different kinds of [exotic objects] by those objects' internal methods. An object that is behaviourally equivalent to a particular kind of [exotic object] (such as an [Array exotic object] or a [bound function exotic object]), but does not have the same collection of internal methods specified for that kind, is not recognized as that kind of [exotic object].\n\nThe “Signature” column of [Table 4] and other similar tables describes the invocation pattern for each internal method. The invocation pattern always includes a parenthesized list of descriptive parameter names. If a parameter name is the same as an ECMAScript type name then the name describes the required type of the parameter value. If an internal method explicitly returns a value, its parameter list is followed by the symbol “→” and the type name of the returned value. The type names used in signatures refer to the types defined in clause [6] augmented by the following additional names. “_any_” means the value may be any [ECMAScript language type].\n\nIn addition to its parameters, an internal method always has access to the object that is the target of the method invocation.\n\nAn internal method implicitly returns a [Completion Record], either a [normal completion] that wraps a value of the return type shown in its invocation pattern, or a [throw completion].\n\nTable 4: Essential Internal Methods\n\n| Internal Method | Signature | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [GetPrototypeOf] | ( ) **→** Object \\| Null | Determine the object that provides inherited properties for this object. A null value indicates that there are no inherited properties. |\n| [SetPrototypeOf] | (Object \\| Null) **→** Boolean | Associate this object with another object that provides inherited properties. Passing null indicates that there are no inherited properties. Returns true indicating that the operation was completed successfully or false indicating that the operation was not successful. |\n| [IsExtensible] | ( ) **→** Boolean | Determine whether it is permitted to add additional properties to this object. |\n| [PreventExtensions] | ( ) **→** Boolean | Control whether new properties may be added to this object. Returns true if the operation was successful or false if the operation was unsuccessful. |\n| [GetOwnProperty] | (propertyKey) **→** Undefined \\| [Property Descriptor] | Return a [Property Descriptor] for the own property of this object whose key is propertyKey, or undefined if no such property exists. |\n| [DefineOwnProperty] | (propertyKey, PropertyDescriptor) **→** Boolean | Create or alter the own property, whose key is propertyKey, to have the state described by PropertyDescriptor. Return true if that property was successfully created/updated or false if the property could not be created or updated. |\n| [HasProperty] | (propertyKey) **→** Boolean | Return a Boolean value indicating whether this object already has either an own or inherited property whose key is propertyKey. |\n| [Get] | (propertyKey, Receiver) **→** _any_ | Return the value of the property whose key is propertyKey from this object. If any ECMAScript code must be executed to retrieve the property value, Receiver is used as the this value when evaluating the code. |\n| [Set] | (propertyKey, value, Receiver) **→** Boolean | Set the value of the property whose key is propertyKey to value. If any ECMAScript code must be executed to set the property value, Receiver is used as the this value when evaluating the code. Returns true if the property value was set or false if it could not be set. |\n| [Delete] | (propertyKey) **→** Boolean | Remove the own property whose key is propertyKey from this object. Return false if the property was not deleted and is still present. Return true if the property was deleted or is not present. |\n| [OwnPropertyKeys] | ( ) **→** [List] of [property keys] | Return a [List] whose elements are all of the own [property keys] for the object. |\n\n[Table 5] summarizes additional essential internal methods that are supported by objects that may be called as functions. A function object is an object that supports the [Call] internal method. A constructor is an object that supports the [Construct] internal method. Every object that supports [Construct] must support [Call]; that is, every [constructor] must be a [function object]. Therefore, a [constructor] may also be referred to as a _[constructor] function_ or _[constructor] [function object]_.\n\nTable 5: Additional Essential Internal Methods of Function Objects\n\n| Internal Method | Signature | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Call] | (_any_, a [List] of _any_) **→** _any_ | Executes code associated with this object. Invoked via a function call expression. The arguments to the internal method are a this value and a [List] whose elements are the arguments passed to the function by a call expression. Objects that implement this internal method are _callable_. |\n| [Construct] | (a [List] of _any_, Object) **→** Object | Creates an object. Invoked via the `new` operator or a `super` call. The first argument to the internal method is a [List] whose elements are the arguments of the [constructor] invocation or the `super` call. The second argument is the object to which the `new` operator was initially applied. Objects that implement this internal method are called _[constructors]_. A [function object] is not necessarily a [constructor] and such non-[constructor] [function objects] do not have a [Construct] internal method. |\n\nThe semantics of the essential internal methods for [ordinary objects] and standard [exotic objects] are specified in clause [10].

{"instruction": "6.2 ECMAScript Specification Types", "input": "", "output": "A specification type corresponds to meta-values that are used within algorithms to describe the semantics of ECMAScript language constructs and [ECMAScript language types]. The specification types include [Reference Record], [List], [Completion Record], [Property Descriptor], [Environment Record], [Abstract Closure], and [Data Block]. Specification type values are specification artefacts that do not necessarily correspond to any specific entity within an ECMAScript implementation. Specification type values may be used to describe intermediate results of ECMAScript expression evaluation but such values cannot be stored as properties of objects or values of ECMAScript language variables."}
{"instruction": "6.2.1 The Enum Specification Type", "input": "", "output": "Enums are values which are internal to the specification and not directly observable from ECMAScript code. Enums are denoted using a sans-serif typeface. For instance, a [Completion Record]'s [Type] field takes on values like normal, return, or throw. Enums have no characteristics other than their name. The name of an enum serves no purpose other than to distinguish it from other enums, and implies nothing about its usage or meaning in context."}
{"instruction": "6.2.2 The List and Record Specification Types", "input": "", "output": "The List type is used to explain the evaluation of argument lists (see [13.3.8]) in `new` expressions, in function calls, and in other algorithms where a simple ordered list of values is needed. Values of the List type are simply ordered sequences of list elements containing the individual values. These sequences may be of any length. The elements of a list may be randomly accessed using 0-origin indices. For notational convenience an array-like syntax can be used to access List elements. For example, arguments\\[2\\] is shorthand for saying the 3rd element of the List arguments.\n\nWhen an algorithm iterates over the elements of a List without specifying an order, the order used is the order of the elements in the List.\n\nFor notational convenience within this specification, a literal syntax can be used to express a new List value. For example, « 1, 2 » defines a List value that has two elements each of which is initialized to a specific value. A new empty List can be expressed as « ».\n\nIn this specification, the phrase \"the list-concatenation of A, B, ...\" (where each argument is a possibly empty List) denotes a new List value whose elements are the concatenation of the elements (in order) of each of the arguments (in order).\n\nAs applied to a List of Strings, the phrase \"sorted according to lexicographic code unit order\" means sorting by the numeric value of each code unit up to the length of the shorter string, and sorting the shorter string before the longer string if all are equal, as described in the abstract operation [IsLessThan].\n\nThe Record type is used to describe data aggregations within the algorithms of this specification. A Record type value consists of one or more named fields. The value of each field is an [ECMAScript language value] or specification value. Field names are always enclosed in double brackets, for example [Value].\n\nFor notational convenience within this specification, an object literal-like syntax can be used to express a Record value. For example, { [Field1]: 42, [Field2]: false, [Field3]: empty } defines a Record value that has three fields, each of which is initialized to a specific value. Field name order is not significant. Any fields that are not explicitly listed are considered to be absent.\n\nIn specification text and algorithms, dot notation may be used to refer to a specific field of a Record value. For example, if R is the record shown in the previous paragraph then R.[Field2] is shorthand for “the field of R named [Field2]”.\n\nSchema for commonly used Record field combinations may be named, and that name may be used as a prefix to a literal Record value to identify the specific kind of aggregations that is being described. For example: PropertyDescriptor { [Value]: 42, [Writable]: false, [Configurable]: true }."}
{"instruction": "6.2.3 The Set and Relation Specification Types", "input": "", "output": "The _Set_ type is used to explain a collection of unordered elements for use in the [memory model]. It is distinct from the ECMAScript collection type of the same name. To disambiguate, instances of the ECMAScript collection are consistently referred to as \"Set objects\" within this specification. Values of the Set type are simple collections of elements, where no element appears more than once. Elements may be added to and removed from Sets. Sets may be unioned, intersected, or subtracted from each other.\n\nThe Relation type is used to explain constraints on Sets. Values of the Relation type are Sets of ordered pairs of values from its value domain. For example, a Relation on events is a set of ordered pairs of events. For a Relation R and two values a and b in the value domain of R, a R b is shorthand for saying the ordered pair (a, b) is a member of R. A Relation is the least Relation with respect to some conditions when it is the smallest Relation that satisfies those conditions.\n\nA strict partial order is a Relation value R that satisfies the following.\n\n* For all a, b, and c in R's domain:\n    \n    * It is not the case that a R a, and\n    * If a R b and b R c, then a R c.\n\nNote 1\n\nThe two properties above are called irreflexivity and transitivity, respectively.\n\nA strict total order is a Relation value R that satisfies the following.\n\n* For all a, b, and c in R's domain:\n    \n    * a is b or a R b or b R a, and\n    * It is not the case that a R a, and\n    * If a R b and b R c, then a R c.\n\nNote 2\n\nThe three properties above are called totality, irreflexivity, and transitivity, respectively."}

A byte value is an [integer] in the [inclusive interval] from 0 to 255. A Data Block value is created with a fixed number of bytes that each have the initial value 0.\n\nFor notational convenience within this specification, an array-like syntax can be used to access the individual bytes of a Data Block value. This notation presents a Data Block value as a 0-based integer-indexed sequence of bytes. For example, if db is a 5 byte Data Block value then db\\[2\\] can be used to access its 3rd byte.\n\nA data block that resides in memory that can be referenced from multiple [agents] concurrently is designated a Shared Data Block. A Shared Data Block has an identity (for the purposes of equality testing Shared Data Block values) that is _address-free_: it is tied not to the virtual addresses the block is mapped to in any process, but to the set of locations in memory that the block represents. Two data blocks are equal only if the sets of the locations they contain are equal; otherwise, they are not equal and the intersection of the sets of locations they contain is empty. Finally, Shared Data Blocks can be distinguished from Data Blocks.\n\nThe semantics of Shared Data Blocks is defined using [Shared Data Block events] by the [memory model]. [Abstract operations] below introduce [Shared Data Block events] and act as the interface between evaluation semantics and the event semantics of the [memory model].

{"instruction": "9.1 Environment Records", "input": "", "output": "Environment Record is a specification type used to define the association of [Identifier]s to specific variables and functions, based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code. Usually an Environment Record is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a [FunctionDeclaration], a [BlockStatement], or a [Catch] clause of a [TryStatement]. Each time such code is evaluated, a new Environment Record is created to record the identifier bindings that are created by that code.\n\nEvery Environment Record has an [OuterEnv] field, which is either null or a reference to an outer Environment Record. This is used to model the logical nesting of Environment Record values. The outer reference of an (inner) Environment Record is a reference to the Environment Record that logically surrounds the inner Environment Record. An outer Environment Record may, of course, have its own outer Environment Record. An Environment Record may serve as the outer environment for multiple inner Environment Records. For example, if a [FunctionDeclaration] contains two nested [FunctionDeclaration]s then the Environment Records of each of the nested functions will have as their outer Environment Record the Environment Record of the current evaluation of the surrounding function.\n\nEnvironment Records are purely specification mechanisms and need not correspond to any specific artefact of an ECMAScript implementation. It is impossible for an ECMAScript program to directly access or manipulate such values."}
{"instruction": "9.1.1 The Environment Record Type Hierarchy", "input": "", "output": "[Environment Records] can be thought of as existing in a simple object-oriented hierarchy where [Environment Record] is an abstract class with three concrete subclasses: [Declarative Environment Record], [Object Environment Record], and [Global Environment Record]. [Function Environment Records] and [Module Environment Records] are subclasses of [Declarative Environment Record].\n\n* [Environment Record] (abstract)\n    \n    * A _[Declarative Environment Record]_ is used to define the effect of ECMAScript language syntactic elements such as [FunctionDeclaration]s, [VariableDeclaration]s, and [Catch] clauses that directly associate identifier bindings with [ECMAScript language values].\n        \n        * A _[Function Environment Record]_ corresponds to the invocation of an ECMAScript [function object], and contains bindings for the top-level declarations within that function. It may establish a new `this` binding. It also captures the state necessary to support `super` method invocations.\n            \n        * A _[Module Environment Record]_ contains the bindings for the top-level declarations of a [Module]. It also contains the bindings that are explicitly imported by the [Module]. Its [OuterEnv] is a [Global Environment Record].\n            \n    * An _[Object Environment Record]_ is used to define the effect of ECMAScript elements such as [WithStatement] that associate identifier bindings with the properties of some object.\n        \n    * A _[Global Environment Record]_ is used for [Script] global declarations. It does not have an outer environment; its [OuterEnv] is null. It may be prepopulated with identifier bindings and it includes an associated [global object] whose properties provide some of the global environment's identifier bindings. As ECMAScript code is executed, additional properties may be added to the [global object] and the initial properties may be modified.\n        \n\nThe [Environment Record] abstract class includes the abstract specification methods defined in [Table 16]. These abstract methods have distinct concrete algorithms for each of the concrete subclasses.\n\nTable 16: Abstract Methods of [Environment Records]\n\n| Method | Purpose |\n| --- | --- |\n| HasBinding(N) | Determine if an [Environment Record] has a binding for the String value N. Return true if it does and false if it does not. |\n| CreateMutableBinding(N, D) | Create a new but uninitialized mutable binding in an [Environment Record]. The String value N is the text of the bound name. If the Boolean argument D is true the binding may be subsequently deleted. |\n| CreateImmutableBinding(N, S) | Create a new but uninitialized immutable binding in an [Environment Record]. The String value N is the text of the bound name. If S is true then attempts to set it after it has been initialized will always throw an exception, regardless of the strict mode setting of operations that reference that binding. |\n| InitializeBinding(N, V) | Set the value of an already existing but uninitialized binding in an [Environment Record]. The String value N is the text of the bound name. V is the value for the binding and is a value of any [ECMAScript language type]. |\n| SetMutableBinding(N, V, S) | Set the value of an already existing mutable binding in an [Environment Record]. The String value N is the text of the bound name. V is the value for the binding and may be a value of any [ECMAScript language type]. S [is a Boolean] flag. If S is true and the binding cannot be set throw a TypeError exception. |\n| GetBindingValue(N, S) | Returns the value of an already existing binding from an [Environment Record]. The String value N is the text of the bound name. S is used to identify references originating in [strict mode code] or that otherwise require strict mode reference semantics. If S is true and the binding does not exist throw a ReferenceError exception. If the binding exists but is uninitialized a ReferenceError is thrown, regardless of the value of S. |\n| DeleteBinding(N) | Delete a binding from an [Environment Record].

At any point in time, there is at most one execution context per [agent] that is actually executing code. This is known as the [agent]'s running execution context. All references to the [running execution context] in this specification denote the [running execution context] of the [surrounding agent].\n\nThe execution context stack is used to track execution contexts. The [running execution context] is always the top element of this stack. A new execution context is created whenever control is transferred from the executable code associated with the currently [running execution context] to executable code that is not associated with that execution context. The newly created execution context is pushed onto the stack and becomes the [running execution context].\n\nAn execution context contains whatever implementation specific state is necessary to track the execution progress of its associated code. Each execution context has at least the state components listed in [Table 25].\n\nTable 25: State Components for All Execution Contexts\n\n| Component | Purpose |\n| --- | --- |\n| code evaluation state | Any state needed to perform, suspend, and resume evaluation of the code associated with this [execution context]. |\n| Function | If this [execution context] is evaluating the code of a [function object], then the value of this component is that [function object]. If the context is evaluating the code of a [Script] or [Module], the value is null. |\n| [Realm] | The [Realm Record] from which associated code accesses ECMAScript resources. |\n| ScriptOrModule | The [Module Record] or [Script Record] from which associated code originates. If there is no originating script or module, as is the case for the original [execution context] created in [InitializeHostDefinedRealm], the value is null. |\n\n[Evaluation] of code by the [running execution context] may be suspended at various points defined within this specification. Once the [running execution context] has been suspended a different execution context may become the [running execution context] and commence evaluating its code. At some later time a suspended execution context may again become the [running execution context] and continue evaluating its code at the point where it had previously been suspended. Transition of the [running execution context] status among execution contexts usually occurs in stack-like last-in/first-out manner. However, some ECMAScript features require non-LIFO transitions of the [running execution context].\n\nThe value of the [Realm] component of the [running execution context] is also called the current Realm Record. The value of the Function component of the [running execution context] is also called the active function object.\n\nECMAScript code execution contexts have the additional state components listed in [Table 26].\n\nTable 26: Additional State Components for ECMAScript Code Execution Contexts\n\n| Component | Purpose |\n| --- | --- |\n| LexicalEnvironment | Identifies the [Environment Record] used to resolve identifier references made by code within this [execution context]. |\n| VariableEnvironment | Identifies the [Environment Record] that holds bindings created by [VariableStatement]s within this [execution context]. |\n| PrivateEnvironment | Identifies the [PrivateEnvironment Record] that holds [Private Names] created by [ClassElement]s in the nearest containing class. null if there is no containing class. |\n\nThe LexicalEnvironment and VariableEnvironment components of an execution context are always [Environment Records].\n\nExecution contexts representing the evaluation of Generators have the additional state components listed in [Table 27].\n\nTable 27: Additional State Components for Generator Execution Contexts\n\n| Component | Purpose |\n| --- | --- |\n| Generator | The Generator that this [execution context] is evaluating. |\n\nIn most situations only the [running execution context] (the top of the [execution context stack]) is directly manipulated by algorithms within this specification.

This list is reset when synchronous work is done using the [ClearKeptObjects] abstract operation.\n* When an object or symbol which is registered with a [FinalizationRegistry] becomes unreachable, a call of the [FinalizationRegistry]'s cleanup callback may eventually be made, after synchronous ECMAScript execution completes.

One, that a [WeakRef] itself does not keep its referent alive. Two, that cycles in liveness does not imply that a value is live. To be concrete, if determining v's liveness depends on determining the liveness of a [WeakRef] referent, r, r's liveness cannot assume v's liveness, which would be circular reasoning.\n\nNote 2\n\n[WeakRef]-obliviousness is defined on sets of objects or symbols instead of individual values to account for cycles. If it were defined on individual values, then a [WeakRef] referent in a cycle will be considered live even though its identity is only observed via other [WeakRef] referents in the cycle.\n\nNote 3\n\nColloquially, we say that an individual object or symbol is live if every set containing it is live.\n\nAt any point during evaluation, a set of objects and/or symbols S is considered live if either of the following conditions is met:\n\n* Any element in S is included in any [agent]'s [KeptAlive] [List].\n* There exists a valid future hypothetical WeakRef-oblivious execution with respect to S that observes the identity of any value in S.\n\nNote 4\n\nThe second condition above intends to capture the intuition that a value is live if its identity is observable via non-[WeakRef] means. A value's identity may be observed by observing a strict equality comparison or observing the value being used as key in a Map.\n\nNote 5\n\nPresence of an object or a symbol in a field, an internal slot, or a property does not imply that the value is live. For example if the value in question is never passed back to the program, then it cannot be observed.\n\nThis is the case for keys in a WeakMap, members of a WeakSet, as well as the [WeakRefTarget] and [UnregisterToken] fields of a [FinalizationRegistry] Cell record.\n\nThe above definition implies that, if a key in a WeakMap is not live, then its corresponding value is not necessarily live either.\n\nNote 6\n\nLiveness is the lower bound for guaranteeing which [WeakRefs] engines must not empty.

Depending upon the characteristics of the function definition, its arguments object is either an [ordinary object] or an [arguments exotic object]. An [arguments exotic object] is an [exotic object] whose [array index] properties map to the formal parameters bindings of an invocation of its associated ECMAScript function.\n\nAn object is an arguments exotic object if its internal methods use the following implementations, with the ones not specified here using those found in [10.1]. These methods are installed in [CreateMappedArgumentsObject].\n\nNote 1\n\nWhile [CreateUnmappedArgumentsObject] is grouped into this clause, it creates an [ordinary object], not an [arguments exotic object].\n\n[Arguments exotic objects] have the same internal slots as [ordinary objects]. They also have a [ParameterMap] internal slot. Ordinary arguments objects also have a [ParameterMap] internal slot whose value is always undefined. For ordinary argument objects the [ParameterMap] internal slot is only used by `Object.prototype.toString` ([20.1.3.6]) to identify them as such.\n\nNote 2\n\nThe [integer-indexed] [data properties] of an [arguments exotic object] whose numeric name values are less than the number of formal parameters of the corresponding [function object] initially share their values with the corresponding argument bindings in the function's [execution context]. This means that changing the property changes the corresponding value of the argument binding and vice-versa. This correspondence is broken if such a property is deleted and then redefined or if the property is changed into an [accessor property]. If the arguments object is an [ordinary object], the values of its properties are simply a copy of the arguments passed to the function and there is no dynamic linkage between the property values and the formal parameter values.\n\nNote 3\n\nThe ParameterMap object and its property values are used as a device for specifying the arguments object correspondence to argument bindings. The ParameterMap object and the objects that are the values of its properties are not directly observable from ECMAScript code. An ECMAScript implementation does not need to actually create or use such objects to implement the specified semantics.\n\nNote 4\n\nOrdinary arguments objects define a non-configurable [accessor property] named \"callee\" which throws a TypeError exception on access. The \"callee\" property has a more specific meaning for [arguments exotic objects], which are created only for some class of [non-strict functions]. The definition of this property in the ordinary variant exists to ensure that it is not defined in any other manner by conforming ECMAScript implementations.\n\nNote 5\n\nECMAScript implementations of [arguments exotic objects] have historically contained an [accessor property] named \"caller\". Prior to ECMAScript 2017, this specification included the definition of a throwing \"caller\" property on ordinary arguments objects. Since implementations do not contain this extension any longer, ECMAScript 2017 dropped the requirement for a throwing \"caller\" accessor."}

{"instruction": "10.5 Proxy Object Internal Methods and Internal Slots", "input": "", "output": "A Proxy object is an [exotic object] whose essential internal methods are partially implemented using ECMAScript code. Every Proxy object has an internal slot called [ProxyHandler]. The value of [ProxyHandler] is an object, called the proxy's _handler object_, or null. Methods (see [Table 34]) of a handler object may be used to augment the implementation for one or more of the Proxy object's internal methods. Every Proxy object also has an internal slot called [ProxyTarget] whose value is either an object or null. This object is called the proxy's _target object_.\n\nAn object is a Proxy exotic object if its essential internal methods (including [Call] and [Construct], if applicable) use the definitions in this section. These internal methods are installed in [ProxyCreate].\n\nTable 34: Proxy Handler Methods\n\n| Internal Method | Handler Method |\n| --- | --- |\n| [GetPrototypeOf] | `getPrototypeOf` |\n| [SetPrototypeOf] | `setPrototypeOf` |\n| [IsExtensible] | `isExtensible` |\n| [PreventExtensions] | `preventExtensions` |\n| [GetOwnProperty] | `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` |\n| [DefineOwnProperty] | `defineProperty` |\n| [HasProperty] | `has` |\n| [Get] | `get` |\n| [Set] | `set` |\n| [Delete] | `deleteProperty` |\n| [OwnPropertyKeys] | `ownKeys` |\n| [Call] | `apply` |\n| [Construct] | `construct` |\n\nWhen a handler method is called to provide the implementation of a Proxy object internal method, the handler method is passed the proxy's target object as a parameter. A proxy's handler object does not necessarily have a method corresponding to every essential internal method. Invoking an internal method on the proxy results in the invocation of the corresponding internal method on the proxy's target object if the handler object does not have a method corresponding to the internal trap.\n\nThe [ProxyHandler] and [ProxyTarget] internal slots of a Proxy object are always initialized when the object is created and typically may not be modified. Some Proxy objects are created in a manner that permits them to be subsequently _revoked_. When a proxy is revoked, its [ProxyHandler] and [ProxyTarget] internal slots are set to null causing subsequent invocations of internal methods on that Proxy object to throw a TypeError exception.\n\nBecause Proxy objects permit the implementation of internal methods to be provided by arbitrary ECMAScript code, it is possible to define a Proxy object whose handler methods violates the invariants defined in [6.1.7.3]. Some of the internal method invariants defined in [6.1.7.3] are essential integrity invariants. These invariants are explicitly enforced by the Proxy object internal methods specified in this section. An ECMAScript implementation must be robust in the presence of all possible invariant violations.\n\nIn the following algorithm descriptions, assume O is an ECMAScript Proxy object, P is a [property key] value, V is any [ECMAScript language value] and Desc is a [Property Descriptor] record."}

All Unicode code point values from U+0000 to U+10FFFF, including surrogate code points, may occur in ECMAScript source text where permitted by the ECMAScript grammars. The actual encodings used to store and interchange ECMAScript source text is not relevant to this specification. Regardless of the external source text encoding, a conforming ECMAScript implementation processes the source text as if it was an equivalent sequence of [SourceCharacter] values, each [SourceCharacter] being a Unicode code point. Conforming ECMAScript implementations are not required to perform any normalization of source text, or behave as though they were performing normalization of source text.\n\nThe components of a combining character sequence are treated as individual Unicode code points even though a user might think of the whole sequence as a single character.\n\nNote\n\nIn string literals, regular expression literals, template literals and identifiers, any Unicode code point may also be expressed using Unicode escape sequences that explicitly express a code point's numeric value. Within a comment, such an escape sequence is effectively ignored as part of the comment.\n\nECMAScript differs from the Java programming language in the behaviour of Unicode escape sequences. In a Java program, if the Unicode escape sequence `\\u000A`, for example, occurs within a single-line comment, it is interpreted as a line terminator (Unicode code point U+000A is LINE FEED (LF)) and therefore the next code point is not part of the comment. Similarly, if the Unicode escape sequence `\\u000A` occurs within a string literal in a Java program, it is likewise interpreted as a line terminator, which is not allowed within a string literal—one must write `\\n` instead of `\\u000A` to cause a LINE FEED (LF) to be part of the value of a string literal. In an ECMAScript program, a Unicode escape sequence occurring within a comment is never interpreted and therefore cannot contribute to termination of the comment. Similarly, a Unicode escape sequence occurring within a string literal in an ECMAScript program always contributes to the literal and is never interpreted as a line terminator or as a code point that might terminate the string literal."}

{"instruction": "12.7.2 Keywords and Reserved Words", "input": "", "output": "A keyword is a token that matches [IdentifierName], but also has a syntactic use; that is, it appears literally, in a `fixed width` font, in some syntactic production. The keywords of ECMAScript include `if`, `while`, `async`, `await`, and many others.\n\nA reserved word is an [IdentifierName] that cannot be used as an identifier. Many keywords are reserved words, but some are not, and some are reserved only in certain contexts. `if` and `while` are reserved words. `await` is reserved only inside async functions and modules. `async` is not reserved; it can be used as a variable name or statement label without restriction.\n\nThis specification uses a combination of grammatical productions and [early error] rules to specify which names are valid identifiers and which are reserved words. All tokens in the [ReservedWord] list below, except for `await` and `yield`, are unconditionally reserved. Exceptions for `await` and `yield` are specified in [13.1], using parameterized syntactic productions. Lastly, several [early error] rules restrict the set of valid identifiers. See [13.1.1], [14.3.1.1], [14.7.5.1], and [15.7.1]. In summary, there are five categories of identifier names:\n\n* Those that are always allowed as identifiers, and are not keywords, such as `Math`, `window`, `toString`, and `_`;\n    \n* Those that are never allowed as identifiers, namely the [ReservedWord]s listed below except `await` and `yield`;\n    \n* Those that are contextually allowed as identifiers, namely `await` and `yield`;\n    \n* Those that are contextually disallowed as identifiers, in [strict mode code]: `let`, `static`, `implements`, `interface`, `package`, `private`, `protected`, and `public`;\n    \n* Those that are always allowed as identifiers, but also appear as keywords within certain syntactic productions, at places where [Identifier] is not allowed: `as`, `async`, `from`, `get`, `meta`, `of`, `set`, and `target`.\n    \n\nThe term conditional keyword, or contextual keyword, is sometimes used to refer to the keywords that fall in the last three categories, and thus can be used as identifiers in some contexts and as keywords in others."}

A code point in a keyword cannot be expressed by a `\\` [UnicodeEscapeSequence].\n\nAn [IdentifierName] can contain `\\` [UnicodeEscapeSequence]s, but it is not possible to declare a variable named \"else\" by spelling it `els\\u{65}`. The [early error] rules in [13.1.1] rule out identifiers with the same [StringValue] as a reserved word.\n\nNote 2\n\n`enum` is not currently used as a keyword in this specification. It is a _future reserved word_, set aside for use as a keyword in future language extensions.\n\nSimilarly, `implements`, `interface`, `package`, `private`, `protected`, and `public` are future reserved words in [strict mode code].\n\nNote 3\n\nThe names `arguments` and `eval` are not keywords, but they are subject to some restrictions in [strict mode code].

These situations are described by saying that semicolons are automatically inserted into the source code token stream in those situations."}
{"instruction": "12.10.1 Rules of Automatic Semicolon Insertion", "input": "", "output": "In the following rules, “token” means the actual recognized lexical token determined using the current lexical [goal symbol] as described in clause [12].\n\nThere are three basic rules of semicolon insertion:\n\n1.  When, as the source text is parsed from left to right, a token (called the _offending token_) is encountered that is not allowed by any production of the grammar, then a semicolon is automatically inserted before the offending token if one or more of the following conditions is true:\n    \n    * The offending token is separated from the previous token by at least one [LineTerminator].\n    * The offending token is `}`.\n    * The previous token is `)` and the inserted semicolon would then be parsed as the terminating semicolon of a do-while statement ([14.7.2]).\n2.  When, as the source text is parsed from left to right, the end of the input stream of tokens is encountered and the parser is unable to parse the input token stream as a single instance of the goal nonterminal, then a semicolon is automatically inserted at the end of the input stream.\n3.  When, as the source text is parsed from left to right, a token is encountered that is allowed by some production of the grammar, but the production is a _restricted production_ and the token would be the first token for a terminal or nonterminal immediately following the annotation “\\[no [LineTerminator] here\\]” within the restricted production (and therefore such a token is called a restricted token), and the restricted token is separated from the previous token by at least one [LineTerminator], then a semicolon is automatically inserted before the restricted token.\n\nHowever, there is an additional overriding condition on the preceding rules: a semicolon is never inserted automatically if the semicolon would then be parsed as an empty statement or if that semicolon would become one of the two semicolons in the header of a `for` statement (see [14.7.4]).\n\nNote\n\nThe following are the only restricted productions in the grammar:\n\n[UpdateExpression]\\[Yield, Await\\] : [LeftHandSideExpression]\\[?Yield, ?Await\\] \\[no [LineTerminator] here\\] ++ [LeftHandSideExpression]\\[?Yield, ?Await\\] \\[no [LineTerminator] here\\] -- [ContinueStatement]\\[Yield, Await\\] : continue ;

Otherwise, return true.\n\nNote 1\n\nGiven the above definition of equality:\n\n* String comparison can be forced by: `` `${a}` == `${b}` ``.\n* Numeric comparison can be forced by: `+a == +b`.\n* Boolean comparison can be forced by: `!a == !b`.\n\nNote 2\n\nThe equality operators maintain the following invariants:\n\n* `A != B` is equivalent to `!(A == B)`.\n* `A == B` is equivalent to `B == A`, except in the order of evaluation of `A` and `B`.\n\nNote 3\n\nThe equality operator is not always transitive. For example, there might be two distinct String objects, each representing the same String value; each String object would be considered equal to the String value by the `==` operator, but the two String objects would not be equal to each other. For example:\n\n* `new String(\"a\") == \"a\"` and `\"a\" == new String(\"a\")` are both true.\n* `new String(\"a\") == new String(\"a\")` is false.\n\nNote 4\n\nComparison of Strings uses a simple equality test on sequences of code unit values. There is no attempt to use the more complex, semantically oriented definitions of character or string equality and collating order defined in the Unicode specification. Therefore Strings values that are canonically equal according to the Unicode Standard could test as unequal. In effect this algorithm assumes that both Strings are already in normalized form."}

It performs the following steps when called:\n\n1.  Return an [iterator object] whose `next` method iterates over all the String-valued keys of enumerable properties of O. The [iterator object] is never directly accessible to ECMAScript code. The mechanics and order of enumerating the properties is not specified but must conform to the rules specified below.\n\nThe [iterator]'s `throw` and `return` methods are null and are never invoked. The [iterator]'s `next` method processes object properties to determine whether the [property key] should be returned as an [iterator] value. Returned [property keys] do not include keys that are Symbols. Properties of the target object may be deleted during enumeration. A property that is deleted before it is processed by the [iterator]'s `next` method is ignored. If new properties are added to the target object during enumeration, the newly added properties are not guaranteed to be processed in the active enumeration. A [property name] will be returned by the [iterator]'s `next` method at most once in any enumeration.\n\nEnumerating the properties of the target object includes enumerating properties of its prototype, and the prototype of the prototype, and so on, recursively; but a property of a prototype is not processed if it has the same name as a property that has already been processed by the [iterator]'s `next` method. The values of [Enumerable] attributes are not considered when determining if a property of a prototype object has already been processed. The enumerable property names of prototype objects must be obtained by invoking EnumerateObjectProperties passing the prototype object as the argument. EnumerateObjectProperties must obtain the own [property keys] of the target object by calling its [OwnPropertyKeys] internal method. Property attributes of the target object must be obtained by calling its [GetOwnProperty] internal method.\n\nIn addition, if neither O nor any object in its prototype chain is a [Proxy exotic object], [TypedArray], [module namespace exotic object], or implementation provided [exotic object], then the [iterator] must behave as would the [iterator] given by [CreateForInIterator](O) until one of the following occurs:\n\n* the value of the [Prototype] internal slot of O or an object in its prototype chain changes,\n* a property is removed from O or an object in its prototype chain,\n* a property is added to an object in O's prototype chain, or\n* the value of the [Enumerable] attribute of a property of O or an object in its prototype chain changes.\n\nNote 1\n\nECMAScript implementations are not required to implement the algorithm in [14.7.5.10.2.1] directly. They may choose any implementation whose behaviour will not deviate from that algorithm unless one of the constraints in the previous paragraph is violated.\n\nThe following is an informative definition of an ECMAScript generator function that conforms to these rules:\n\n    function* EnumerateObjectProperties(obj) {\n      const visited = new Set();\n      for (const key of Reflect.ownKeys(obj)) {\n        if (typeof key === \"symbol\") continue;\n        const desc = Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, key);\n        if (desc) {\n          visited.add(key);\n          if (desc.enumerable) yield key;\n        }\n      }\n      const proto = Reflect.getPrototypeOf(obj);\n      if (proto === null) return;\n      for (const protoKey of EnumerateObjectProperties(proto)) {\n        if (!visited.has(protoKey)) yield protoKey;\n      }\n    }\n\nNote 2\n\nThe list of [exotic objects] for which implementations are not required to match [CreateForInIterator] was chosen because implementations historically differed in behaviour for those cases, and agreed in all others."}

Once the pending module is executed, the field is set to done. |\n| [TopLevelCapability] | a [PromiseCapability Record] or empty | If this module is the [CycleRoot] of some cycle, and Evaluate() was called on some module in that cycle, this field contains the [PromiseCapability Record] for that entire evaluation. It is used to settle the Promise object that is returned from the Evaluate() abstract method. This field will be empty for any dependencies of that module, unless a top-level Evaluate() has been initiated for some of those dependencies. |\n| [AsyncParentModules] | a [List] of [Cyclic Module Records] | If this module or a dependency has [HasTLA] true, and execution is in progress, this tracks the parent importers of this module for the top-level execution job. These parent modules will not start executing before this module has successfully completed execution. |\n| [PendingAsyncDependencies] | an [integer] or empty | If this module has any asynchronous dependencies, this tracks the number of asynchronous dependency modules remaining to execute for this module. A module with asynchronous dependencies will be executed when this field reaches 0 and there are no execution errors. |\n\nIn addition to the methods defined in [Table 44] [Cyclic Module Records] have the additional methods listed in [Table 46]\n\nTable 46: Additional Abstract Methods of [Cyclic Module Records]\n\n| Method | Purpose |\n| --- | --- |\n| InitializeEnvironment() | Initialize the [Environment Record] of the module, including resolving all imported bindings, and create the module's [execution context]. |\n| ExecuteModule(\\[promiseCapability\\]) | Evaluate the module's code within its [execution context]. If this module has true in [HasTLA], then a [PromiseCapability Record] is passed as an argument, and the method is expected to resolve or reject the given capability. In this case, the method must not throw an exception, but instead reject the [PromiseCapability Record] if necessary. |\n\nA GraphLoadingState Record is a [Record] that contains information about the loading process of a module graph. It's used to continue loading after a call to [HostLoadImportedModule]. Each [GraphLoadingState Record] has the fields defined in [Table 47]:\n\nTable 47: [GraphLoadingState Record] Fields\n\n| Field Name | Value Type | Meaning |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [PromiseCapability] | a [PromiseCapability Record] | The promise to resolve when the loading process finishes. |\n| [IsLoading] | a Boolean | It is true if the loading process has not finished yet, neither successfully nor with an error. |\n| [PendingModulesCount] | a non-negative [integer] | It tracks the number of pending [HostLoadImportedModule] calls. |\n| [Visited] | a [List] of [Cyclic Module Records] | It is a list of the [Cyclic Module Records] that have been already loaded by the current loading process, to avoid infinite loops with circular dependencies. |\n| [HostDefined] | anything (default value is empty) | It contains [host-defined] data to pass from the LoadRequestedModules caller to [HostLoadImportedModule]. |"}

{"instruction": "16.2.1.6.2 Example Cyclic Module Record Graphs", "input": "", "output": "This non-normative section gives a series of examples of the linking and evaluation of a few common module graphs, with a specific focus on how errors can occur.\n\nFirst consider the following simple module graph:\n\nFigure 2: A simple module graph\n\n![A module graph in which module A depends on module B, and module B depends on module C](img/module-graph-simple.svg)\n\nLet's first assume that there are no error conditions. When a [host] first calls A.LoadRequestedModules(), this will complete successfully by assumption, and recursively load the dependencies of B and C as well (respectively, C and none), and then set A.[Status] = B.[Status] = C.[Status] = unlinked. Then, when the [host] calls A.Link(), it will complete successfully (again by assumption) such that A.[Status] = B.[Status] = C.[Status] = linked. These preparatory steps can be performed at any time. Later, when the [host] is ready to incur any possible side effects of the modules, it can call A.Evaluate(), which will complete successfully, returning a Promise resolving to undefined (again by assumption), recursively having evaluated first C and then B. Each module's [Status] at this point will be evaluated.\n\nConsider then cases involving linking errors, after a successful call to A.LoadRequestedModules(). If [InnerModuleLinking] of C succeeds but, thereafter, fails for B, for example because it imports something that C does not provide, then the original A.Link() will fail, and both A and B's [Status] remain unlinked. C's [Status] has become linked, though.\n\nFinally, consider a case involving evaluation errors after a successful call to Link(). If [InnerModuleEvaluation] of C succeeds but, thereafter, fails for B, for example because B contains code that throws an exception, then the original A.Evaluate() will fail, returning a rejected Promise. The resulting exception will be recorded in both A and B's [EvaluationError] fields, and their [Status] will become evaluated. C will also become evaluated but, in contrast to A and B, will remain without an [EvaluationError], as it successfully completed evaluation. Storing the exception ensures that any time a [host] tries to reuse A or B by calling their Evaluate() method, it will encounter the same exception. ([Hosts] are not required to reuse [Cyclic Module Records]; similarly, [hosts] are not required to expose the exception objects thrown by these methods. However, the specification enables such uses.)\n\nNow consider a different type of error condition:\n\nFigure 3: A module graph with an unresolvable module\n\n![A module graph in which module A depends on a missing (unresolvable) module, represented by ???](img/module-graph-missing.svg)\n\nIn this scenario, module A declares a dependency on some other module, but no [Module Record] exists for that module, i.e. [HostLoadImportedModule] calls [FinishLoadingImportedModule] with an exception when asked for it. This could occur for a variety of reasons, such as the corresponding resource not existing, or the resource existing but [ParseModule] returning some errors when trying to parse the resulting source text. [Hosts] can choose to expose the cause of failure via the completion they pass to [FinishLoadingImportedModule]. In any case, this exception causes a loading failure, which results in A's [Status] remaining new.\n\nThe difference here between loading, linking and evaluation errors is due to the following characteristic:\n\n* [Evaluation] must be only performed once, as it can cause side effects; it is thus important to remember whether evaluation has already been performed, even if unsuccessfully. (In the error case, it makes sense to also remember the exception because otherwise subsequent Evaluate() calls would have to synthesize a new one.)\n* Linking, on the other hand, is side-effect-free, and thus even if it fails, it can be retried at a later time with no issues.\n* Loading closely interacts with the [host], and it may be desirable for some of them to allow users to retry failed loads (for example, if the failure is caused by temporarily bad network conditions).\n\nNow, consider a module graph with a cycle:\n\nFigure 4: A cyclic module graph\n\n![A module graph in which module A depends on module B and C, but module B also depends on module A](img/module-graph-cycle.svg)\n\nHere we assume that the entry point is module A, so that the [host] proceeds by calling A.LoadRequestedModules(), which performs [InnerModuleLoading] on A. This in turn calls [InnerModuleLoading] on B and C. Because of the cycle, this again triggers [InnerModuleLoading] on A, but at this point it is a no-op since A's dependencies loading has already been triggered during this LoadRequestedModules process. When all the modules in the graph have been successfully loaded, their [Status] transitions from new to unlinked at the same time.\n\nThen the [host] proceeds by calling A.Link(), which performs [InnerModuleLinking] on A. This in turn calls [InnerModuleLinking] on B. Because of the cycle, this again triggers [InnerModuleLinking] on A, but at this point it is a no-op since A.[Status] is already linking. B.[Status] itself remains linking when control gets back to A and [InnerModuleLinking] is triggered on C. After this returns with C.[Status] being linked, both A and B transition from linking to linked together; this is by design, since they form a strongly connected component. It's possible to transition the status of modules in the same SCC at the same time because during this phase the module graph is traversed with a depth-first search.\n\nAn analogous story occurs for the evaluation phase of a cyclic module graph, in the success case.\n\nNow consider a case where A has a linking error; for example, it tries to import a binding from C that does not exist. In that case, the above steps still occur, including the early return from the second call to [InnerModuleLinking] on A. However, once we unwind back to the original [InnerModuleLinking] on A, it fails during InitializeEnvironment, namely right after C.ResolveExport(). The thrown SyntaxError exception propagates up to A.Link, which resets all modules that are currently on its stack (these are always exactly the modules that are still linking). Hence both A and B become unlinked. Note that C is left as linked.\n\nAlternatively, consider a case where A has an evaluation error; for example, its source code throws an exception. In that case, the evaluation-time analogue of the above steps still occurs, including the early return from the second call to [InnerModuleEvaluation] on A. However, once we unwind back to the original [InnerModuleEvaluation] on A, it fails by assumption. The exception thrown propagates up to A.Evaluate(), which records the error in all modules that are currently on its stack (i.e., the modules that are still evaluating) as well as via [AsyncParentModules], which form a chain for modules which contain or depend on top-level `await` through the whole dependency graph through the [AsyncModuleExecutionRejected] algorithm. Hence both A and B become evaluated and the exception is recorded in both A and B's [EvaluationError] fields, while C is left as evaluated with no [EvaluationError].\n\nLastly, consider a module graph with a cycle, where all modules complete asynchronously:\n\nFigure 5: An asynchronous cyclic module graph\n\n![A module graph in which module A depends on module B and C, module B depends on module D, module C depends on module D and E, and module D depends on module A](img/module-graph-cycle-async.svg)\n\nLoading and linking happen as before, and all modules end up with [Status] set to linked.\n\nCalling A.Evaluate() calls [InnerModuleEvaluation] on A, B, and D, which all transition to evaluating. Then [InnerModuleEvaluation] is called on A again, which is a no-op because it is already evaluating. At this point, D.[PendingAsyncDependencies] is 0, so [ExecuteAsyncModule](D) is called and we call D.ExecuteModule with a new PromiseCapability tracking the asynchronous execution of D. We unwind back to the [InnerModuleEvaluation] on B, setting B.[PendingAsyncDependencies] to 1 and B.[AsyncEvaluationOrder] to 1. We unwind back to the original [InnerModuleEvaluation] on A, setting A.[PendingAsyncDependencies] to 1. In the next iteration of the loop over A's dependencies, we call [InnerModuleEvaluation] on C and thus on D (again a no-op) and E. As E has no dependencies and is not part of a cycle, we call [ExecuteAsyncModule](E) in the same manner as D and E is immediately removed from the stack. We unwind once more to the [InnerModuleEvaluation] on C, setting C.[AsyncEvaluationOrder] to 3. Now we finish the loop over A's dependencies, set A.[AsyncEvaluationOrder] to 4, and remove the entire strongly connected component from the stack, transitioning all of the modules to evaluating-async at once. At this point, the fields of the modules are as given in [Table 48].\n\nTable 48: Module fields after the initial Evaluate() call\n\n| Field<br><br>Module | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [DFSIndex] | 0   | 1   | 3   | 2   | 4   |\n| [DFSAncestorIndex] | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 4   |\n| [Status] | evaluating-async | evaluating-async | evaluating-async | evaluating-async | evaluating-async |\n| [AsyncEvaluationOrder] | 4   | 1   | 3   | 0   | 2   |\n| [AsyncParentModules] | « » | « A » | « A » | « B, C » | « C » |\n| [PendingAsyncDependencies] | 2 (B and C) | 1 (D) | 2 (D and E) | 0   | 0   |\n\nLet us assume that E finishes executing first. When that happens, [AsyncModuleExecutionFulfilled] is called, E.[Status] is set to evaluated and C.[PendingAsyncDependencies] is decremented to become 1. The fields of the updated modules are as given in [Table 49].\n\nTable 49: Module fields after module E finishes executing\n\n| Field<br><br>Module | C   | E   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [DFSIndex] | 3   | 4   |\n| [DFSAncestorIndex] | 0   | 4   |\n| [Status] | evaluating-async | evaluated |\n| [AsyncEvaluationOrder] | 3   | 2   |\n| [AsyncParentModules] | « A » | « C » |\n| [PendingAsyncDependencies] | 1 (D) | 0   |\n\nD is next to finish (as it was the only module that was still executing). When that happens, [AsyncModuleExecutionFulfilled] is called again and D.[Status] is set to evaluated. Its ancestors available for execution are B (whose [AsyncEvaluationOrder] is 1) and C (whose [AsyncEvaluationOrder] is 3), thus B will be handled first: B.[PendingAsyncDependencies] is decremented to become 0, [ExecuteAsyncModule] is called on B, and it starts executing. C.[PendingAsyncDependencies] is also decremented to become 0, and C starts executing (potentially in parallel to B if B contains an `await`). The fields of the updated modules are as given in [Table 50].\n\nTable 50: Module fields after module D finishes executing\n\n| Field<br><br>Module | B   | C   | D   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [DFSIndex] | 1   | 3   | 2   |\n| [DFSAncestorIndex] | 0   | 0   | 0   |\n| [Status] | evaluating-async | evaluating-async | evaluated |\n| [AsyncEvaluationOrder] | 1   | 3   | 0   |\n| [AsyncParentModules] | « A » | « A » | « B, C » |\n| [PendingAsyncDependencies] | 0   | 0   | 0   |\n\nLet us assume that C finishes executing next. When that happens, [AsyncModuleExecutionFulfilled] is called again, C.[Status] is set to evaluated and A.[PendingAsyncDependencies] is decremented to become 1. The fields of the updated modules are as given in [Table 51].\n\nTable 51: Module fields after module C finishes executing\n\n| Field<br><br>Module | A   | C   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [DFSIndex] | 0   | 3   |\n| [DFSAncestorIndex] | 0   | 0   |\n| [Status] | evaluating-async | evaluated |\n| [AsyncEvaluationOrder] | 4   | 3   |\n| [AsyncParentModules] | « » | « A » |\n| [PendingAsyncDependencies] | 1 (B) | 0   |\n\nThen, B finishes executing. When that happens, [AsyncModuleExecutionFulfilled] is called again and B.[Status] is set to evaluated. A.[PendingAsyncDependencies] is decremented to become 0, so [ExecuteAsyncModule] is called and it starts executing. The fields of the updated modules are as given in [Table 52].\n\nTable 52: Module fields after module B finishes executing\n\n| Field<br><br>Module | A   | B   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [DFSIndex] | 0   | 1   |\n| [DFSAncestorIndex] | 0   | 0   |\n| [Status] | evaluating-async | evaluated |\n| [AsyncEvaluationOrder] | 4   | 1   |\n| [AsyncParentModules] | « » | « A » |\n| [PendingAsyncDependencies] | 0   | 0   |\n\nFinally, A finishes executing. When that happens, [AsyncModuleExecutionFulfilled] is called again and A.[Status] is set to evaluated. At this point, the Promise in A.[TopLevelCapability] (which was returned from A.Evaluate()) is resolved, and this concludes the handling of this module graph. The fields of the updated module are as given in [Table 53].\n\nTable 53: Module fields after module A finishes executing\n\n| Field<br><br>Module | A   |\n| --- | --- |\n| [DFSIndex] | 0   |\n| [DFSAncestorIndex] | 0   |\n| [Status] | evaluated |\n| [AsyncEvaluationOrder] | 4   |\n| [AsyncParentModules] | « » |\n| [PendingAsyncDependencies] | 0   |\n\nAlternatively, consider a failure case where C fails execution and returns an error before B has finished executing. When that happens, [AsyncModuleExecutionRejected] is called, which sets C.[Status] to evaluated and C.[EvaluationError] to the error. It then propagates this error to all of the AsyncParentModules by performing [AsyncModuleExecutionRejected] on each of them. The fields of the updated modules are as given in [Table 54].\n\nTable 54: Module fields after module C finishes with an error\n\n| Field<br><br>Module | A   | C   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [DFSIndex] | 0   | 3   |\n| [DFSAncestorIndex] | 0   | 0   |\n| [Status] | evaluated | evaluated |\n| [AsyncEvaluationOrder] | 4   | 3   |\n| [AsyncParentModules] | « » | « A » |\n| [PendingAsyncDependencies] | 1 (B) | 0   |\n| [EvaluationError] | empty | C's evaluation error |\n\nA will be rejected with the same error as C since C will call [AsyncModuleExecutionRejected] on A with C's error. A.[Status] is set to evaluated. At this point the Promise in A.[TopLevelCapability] (which was returned from A.Evaluate()) is rejected. The fields of the updated module are as given in [Table 55].\n\nTable 55: Module fields after module A is rejected\n\n| Field<br><br>Module | A   |\n| --- | --- |\n| [DFSIndex] | 0   |\n| [DFSAncestorIndex] | 0   |\n| [Status] | evaluated |\n| [AsyncEvaluationOrder] | 4   |\n| [AsyncParentModules] | « » |\n| [PendingAsyncDependencies] | 0   |\n| [EvaluationError] | C's [Evaluation] Error |\n\nThen, B finishes executing without an error. When that happens, [AsyncModuleExecutionFulfilled] is called again and B.[Status] is set to evaluated. [GatherAvailableAncestors] is called on B. However, A.[CycleRoot] is A which has an evaluation error, so it will not be added to the returned sortedExecList and [AsyncModuleExecutionFulfilled] will return without further processing. Any future importer of B will resolve the rejection of B.[CycleRoot].[EvaluationError] from the evaluation error from C that was set on the cycle root A. The fields of the updated modules are as given in [Table 56].\n\nTable 56: Module fields after module B finishes executing in an erroring graph\n\n| Field<br><br>Module | A   | B   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [DFSIndex] | 0   | 1   |\n| [DFSAncestorIndex] | 0   | 0   |\n| [Status] | evaluated | evaluated |\n| [AsyncEvaluationOrder] | 4   | 1   |\n| [AsyncParentModules] | « » | « A » |\n| [PendingAsyncDependencies] | 0   | 0   |\n| [EvaluationError] | C's [Evaluation] Error | empty |"}

{"instruction": "18 ECMAScript Standard Built-in Objects", "input": "", "output": "There are certain built-in objects available whenever an ECMAScript [Script] or [Module] begins execution. One, the [global object], is part of the global environment of the executing program. Others are accessible as initial properties of the [global object] or indirectly as properties of accessible built-in objects.\n\nUnless specified otherwise, a built-in object that is callable as a function is a built-in [function object] with the characteristics described in [10.3]. Unless specified otherwise, the [Extensible] internal slot of a built-in object initially has the value true. Every built-in [function object] has a [Realm] internal slot whose value is the [Realm Record] of the [realm] for which the object was initially created.\n\nMany built-in objects are functions: they can be invoked with arguments. Some of them furthermore are [constructors]: they are functions intended for use with the `new` operator. For each built-in function, this specification describes the arguments required by that function and the properties of that [function object]. For each built-in [constructor], this specification furthermore describes properties of the prototype object of that [constructor] and properties of specific object instances returned by a `new` expression that invokes that [constructor].\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function, if a built-in function or [constructor] is given fewer arguments than the function is specified to require, the function or [constructor] shall behave exactly as if it had been given sufficient additional arguments, each such argument being the undefined value. Such missing arguments are considered to be “not present” and may be identified in that manner by specification algorithms. In the description of a particular function, the terms “this value” and “NewTarget” have the meanings given in [10.3].\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function, if a built-in function or [constructor] described is given more arguments than the function is specified to allow, the extra arguments are evaluated by the call and then ignored by the function. However, an implementation may define implementation specific behaviour relating to such arguments as long as the behaviour is not the throwing of a TypeError exception that is predicated simply on the presence of an extra argument.\n\nNote 1\n\nImplementations that add additional capabilities to the set of built-in functions are encouraged to do so by adding new functions rather than adding new parameters to existing functions.\n\nUnless otherwise specified every built-in function and every built-in [constructor] has the [Function prototype object], which is the initial value of the expression `Function.prototype` ([20.2.3]), as the value of its [Prototype] internal slot.\n\nUnless otherwise specified every built-in prototype object has the [Object prototype object], which is the initial value of the expression `Object.prototype` ([20.1.3]), as the value of its [Prototype] internal slot, except the [Object prototype object] itself.\n\nIf this specification defines a built-in [constructor]'s behaviour via algorithm steps, then that is its behaviour for the purposes of both [Call] and [Construct]. If such an algorithm needs to distinguish the two cases, it checks whether NewTarget is undefined, which indicates a [Call] invocation.\n\nBuilt-in [function objects] that are not identified as [constructors] do not implement the [Construct] internal method unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function.\n\nBuilt-in [function objects] that are not [constructors] do not have a \"prototype\" property unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function.\n\nEach built-in function defined in this specification is created by calling the [CreateBuiltinFunction] abstract operation ([10.3.4]). The values of the length and name parameters are the initial values of the \"length\" and \"name\" properties as discussed below. The values of the prefix parameter are similarly discussed below.\n\nEvery built-in [function object], including [constructors], has a \"length\" property whose value is a non-negative [integral Number]. Unless otherwise specified, this value is the number of required parameters shown in the subclause heading for the function description. Optional parameters and rest parameters are not included in the parameter count.\n\nNote 2\n\nFor example, the [function object] that is the initial value of the \"map\" property of the [Array prototype object] is described under the subclause heading «Array.prototype.map (callback \\[ , thisArg\\])» which shows the two named arguments callback and thisArg, the latter being optional; therefore the value of the \"length\" property of that [function object] is 1𝔽.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, the \"length\" property of a built-in [function object] has the attributes { [Writable]: false, [Enumerable]: false, [Configurable]: true }.\n\nEvery built-in [function object], including [constructors], has a \"name\" property whose value [is a String]. Unless otherwise specified, this value is the name that is given to the function in this specification. Functions that are identified as anonymous functions use the empty String as the value of the \"name\" property. For functions that are specified as properties of objects, the name value is the [property name] string used to access the function. Functions that are specified as get or set accessor functions of built-in properties have \"get\" or \"set\" (respectively) passed to the prefix parameter when calling [CreateBuiltinFunction].\n\nThe value of the \"name\" property is explicitly specified for each built-in functions whose [property key] [is a Symbol] value. If such an explicitly specified value starts with the prefix \"get \" or \"set \" and the function for which it is specified is a get or set accessor function of a built-in property, the value without the prefix is passed to the name parameter, and the value \"get\" or \"set\" (respectively) is passed to the prefix parameter when calling [CreateBuiltinFunction].\n\nUnless otherwise specified, the \"name\" property of a built-in [function object] has the attributes { [Writable]: false, [Enumerable]: false, [Configurable]: true }.\n\nEvery other [data property] described in clauses [19] through [28] and in Annex [B.2] has the attributes { [Writable]: true, [Enumerable]: false, [Configurable]: true } unless otherwise specified.\n\nEvery [accessor property] described in clauses [19] through [28] and in Annex [B.2] has the attributes { [Enumerable]: false, [Configurable]: true } unless otherwise specified. If only a get accessor function is described, the set accessor function is the default value, undefined. If only a set accessor is described the get accessor is the default value, undefined."}

A time value that is a multiple of 24 × 60 × 60 × 1000 = 86,400,000 (i.e., is 86,400,000 × d for some [integer] d) represents the instant at the start of the UTC day that follows the [epoch] by d whole UTC days (preceding the [epoch] for negative d). Every other [finite] time value t is defined relative to the greatest preceding time value s that is such a multiple, and represents the instant that occurs within the same UTC day as s but follows it by (t \\- s) milliseconds.\n\nTime values do not account for UTC leap seconds—there are no time values representing instants within positive leap seconds, and there are time values representing instants removed from the UTC timeline by negative leap seconds. However, the definition of time values nonetheless yields piecewise alignment with UTC, with discontinuities only at leap second boundaries and zero difference outside of leap seconds.\n\nA Number can exactly represent all [integers] from -9,007,199,254,740,992 to 9,007,199,254,740,992 ([21.1.2.8] and [21.1.2.6]). A time value supports a slightly smaller range of -8,640,000,000,000,000 to 8,640,000,000,000,000 milliseconds. This yields a supported time value range of exactly -100,000,000 days to 100,000,000 days relative to midnight at the beginning of 1 January 1970 UTC.\n\nThe exact moment of midnight at the beginning of 1 January 1970 UTC is represented by the time value +0𝔽.\n\nNote\n\nIn the proleptic Gregorian calendar, leap years are precisely those which are both divisible by 4 and either divisible by 400 or not divisible by 100.\n\nThe 400 year cycle of the proleptic Gregorian calendar contains 97 leap years. This yields an average of 365.2425 days per year, which is 31,556,952,000 milliseconds. Therefore, the maximum range a Number could represent exactly with millisecond precision is approximately -285,426 to 285,426 years relative to 1970.

{"instruction": "22.2.2 Pattern Semantics", "input": "", "output": "A regular expression pattern is converted into an [Abstract Closure] using the process described below. An implementation is encouraged to use more efficient algorithms than the ones listed below, as long as the results are the same. The [Abstract Closure] is used as the value of a RegExp object's [RegExpMatcher] internal slot.\n\nA [Pattern] is a BMP pattern if its associated flags contain neither a `u` nor a `v`. Otherwise, it is a Unicode pattern. A BMP pattern matches against a String interpreted as consisting of a sequence of 16-bit values that are Unicode code points in the range of the Basic Multilingual Plane. A Unicode pattern matches against a String interpreted as consisting of Unicode code points encoded using UTF-16. In the context of describing the behaviour of a BMP pattern “character” means a single 16-bit Unicode BMP code point. In the context of describing the behaviour of a Unicode pattern “character” means a UTF-16 encoded code point ([6.1.4]). In either context, “character value” means the numeric value of the corresponding non-encoded code point.\n\nThe syntax and semantics of [Pattern] is defined as if the source text for the [Pattern] was a [List] of [SourceCharacter] values where each [SourceCharacter] corresponds to a Unicode code point. If a BMP pattern contains a non-BMP [SourceCharacter] the entire pattern is encoded using UTF-16 and the individual code units of that encoding are used as the elements of the [List].\n\nNote\n\nFor example, consider a pattern expressed in source text as the single non-BMP character U+1D11E (MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF). Interpreted as a Unicode pattern, it would be a single element (character) [List] consisting of the single code point U+1D11E. However, interpreted as a BMP pattern, it is first UTF-16 encoded to produce a two element [List] consisting of the code units 0xD834 and 0xDD1E.\n\nPatterns are passed to the RegExp [constructor] as ECMAScript String values in which non-BMP characters are UTF-16 encoded. For example, the single character MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF pattern, expressed as a String value, [is a String] of length 2 whose elements were the code units 0xD834 and 0xDD1E. So no further translation of the string would be necessary to process it as a BMP pattern consisting of two pattern characters. However, to process it as a Unicode pattern [UTF16SurrogatePairToCodePoint] must be used in producing a [List] whose sole element is a single pattern character, the code point U+1D11E.\n\nAn implementation may not actually perform such translations to or from UTF-16, but the semantics of this specification requires that the result of pattern matching be as if such translations were performed."}
{"instruction": "22.2.2.1 Notation", "input": "", "output": "The descriptions below use the following internal data structures:\n\n* A CharSetElement is one of the two following entities:\n    * If rer.[UnicodeSets] is false, then a CharSetElement is a character in the sense of the Pattern Semantics above.\n    * If rer.[UnicodeSets] is true, then a CharSetElement is a sequence whose elements are characters in the sense of the Pattern Semantics above. This includes the empty sequence, sequences of one character, and sequences of more than one character. For convenience, when working with CharSetElements of this kind, an individual character is treated interchangeably with a sequence of one character.\n* A CharSet is a mathematical set of CharSetElements.\n* A CaptureRange is a [Record] { [StartIndex], [EndIndex] } that represents the range of characters included in a capture, where [StartIndex] is an [integer] representing the start index (inclusive) of the range within Input, and [EndIndex] is an [integer] representing the end index (exclusive) of the range within Input. For any [CaptureRange], these indices must satisfy the invariant that [StartIndex] ≤ [EndIndex].\n* A MatchState is a [Record] { [Input], [EndIndex], [Captures] } where [Input] is a [List] of characters representing the String being matched, [EndIndex] is an [integer], and [Captures] is a [List] of values, one for each [left-capturing parenthesis] in the pattern. [MatchStates] are used to represent partial match states in the regular expression matching algorithms. The [EndIndex] is one plus the index of the last input character matched so far by the pattern, while [Captures] holds the results of capturing parentheses. The nth element of [Captures] is either a [CaptureRange] representing the range of characters captured by the nth set of capturing parentheses, or undefined if the nth set of capturing parentheses hasn't been reached yet. Due to backtracking, many [MatchStates] may be in use at any time during the matching process.\n* A MatcherContinuation is an [Abstract Closure] that takes one [MatchState] argument and returns either a [MatchState] or failure. The [MatcherContinuation] attempts to match the remaining portion (specified by the closure's captured values) of the pattern against Input, starting at the intermediate state given by its [MatchState] argument. If the match succeeds, the [MatcherContinuation] returns the final [MatchState] that it reached; if the match fails, the [MatcherContinuation] returns failure.\n* A Matcher is an [Abstract Closure] that takes two arguments—a [MatchState] and a [MatcherContinuation]—and returns either a [MatchState] or failure. A [Matcher] attempts to match a middle subpattern (specified by the closure's captured values) of the pattern against the [MatchState]'s [Input], starting at the intermediate state given by its [MatchState] argument. The [MatcherContinuation] argument should be a closure that matches the rest of the pattern. After matching the subpattern of a pattern to obtain a new [MatchState], the [Matcher] then calls [MatcherContinuation] on that new [MatchState] to test if the rest of the pattern can match as well. If it can, the [Matcher] returns the [MatchState] returned by [MatcherContinuation]; if not, the [Matcher] may try different choices at its choice points, repeatedly calling [MatcherContinuation] until it either succeeds or all possibilities have been exhausted."}

A [Quantifier] can be non-greedy, in which case the [Atom] pattern is repeated as few times as possible while still matching the sequel, or it can be greedy, in which case the [Atom] pattern is repeated as many times as possible while still matching the sequel. The [Atom] pattern is repeated rather than the input character sequence that it matches, so different repetitions of the [Atom] can match different input substrings.\n\nNote 2\n\nIf the [Atom] and the sequel of the regular expression all have choice points, the [Atom] is first matched as many (or as few, if non-greedy) times as possible. All choices in the sequel are tried before moving on to the next choice in the last repetition of [Atom]. All choices in the last (nth) repetition of [Atom] are tried before moving on to the next choice in the next-to-last (n - 1)st repetition of [Atom]; at which point it may turn out that more or fewer repetitions of [Atom] are now possible; these are exhausted (again, starting with either as few or as many as possible) before moving on to the next choice in the (n - 1)st repetition of [Atom] and so on.\n\nCompare\n\n    /a[a-z]{2,4}/.exec(\"abcdefghi\")\n\nwhich returns \"abcde\" with\n\n    /a[a-z]{2,4}?/.exec(\"abcdefghi\")\n\nwhich returns \"abc\".\n\nConsider also\n\n    /(aa|aabaac|ba|b|c)*/.exec(\"aabaac\")\n\nwhich, by the choice point ordering above, returns the array\n\n    [\"aaba\", \"ba\"]\n\nand not any of:\n\n    [\"aabaac\", \"aabaac\"]\n    [\"aabaac\", \"c\"]\n\nThe above ordering of choice points can be used to write a regular expression that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers (represented in unary notation). The following example calculates the gcd of 10 and 15:\n\n    \"aaaaaaaaaa,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\".replace(/^(a+)\\1*,\\1+$/, \"$1\")\n\nwhich returns the gcd in unary notation \"aaaaa\".\n\nNote 3\n\nStep [4] of the RepeatMatcher clears [Atom]'s captures each time [Atom] is repeated. We can see its behaviour in the regular expression\n\n    /(z)((a+)?(b+)?(c))*/.exec(\"zaacbbbcac\")\n\nwhich returns the array\n\n    [\"zaacbbbcac\", \"z\", \"ac\", \"a\", undefined, \"c\"]\n\nand not\n\n    [\"zaacbbbcac\", \"z\", \"ac\", \"a\", \"bbb\", \"c\"]\n\nbecause each iteration of the outermost `*` clears all captured Strings contained in the quantified [Atom], which in this case includes capture Strings numbered 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nNote 4\n\nStep [2.b] of the RepeatMatcher states that once the minimum number of repetitions has been satisfied, any more expansions of [Atom] that match the empty character sequence are not considered for further repetitions. This prevents the regular expression engine from falling into an infinite loop on patterns such as:\n\n    /(a*)*/.exec(\"b\")\n\nor the slightly more complicated:\n\n    /(a*)b\\1+/.exec(\"baaaac\")\n\nwhich returns the array\n\n    [\"b\", \"\"]"}

The simple mapping always maps to a single code point, so it does not map, for example, `ß` (U+00DF LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S) to `ss` or `SS`. It may however map code points outside the Basic Latin block to code points within it—for example, `ſ` (U+017F LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S) case-folds to `s` (U+0073 LATIN SMALL LETTER S) and `K` (U+212A KELVIN SIGN) case-folds to `k` (U+006B LATIN SMALL LETTER K). Strings containing those code points are matched by regular expressions such as `/[a-z]/ui`.\n\nIn case-insignificant matches when [HasEitherUnicodeFlag](rer) is false, the mapping is based on Unicode Default Case Conversion algorithm toUppercase rather than toCasefold, which results in some subtle differences. For example, `Ω` (U+2126 OHM SIGN) is mapped by toUppercase to itself but by toCasefold to `ω` (U+03C9 GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA) along with `Ω` (U+03A9 GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA), so \"\\\\u2126\" is matched by `/[ω]/ui` and `/[\\u03A9]/ui` but not by `/[ω]/i` or `/[\\u03A9]/i`. Also, no code point outside the Basic Latin block is mapped to a code point within it, so strings such as \"\\\\u017F ſ\" and \"\\\\u212A K\" are not matched by `/[a-z]/i`."}

In this case, the regular expression does not match the empty substring at the beginning or end of the input String, nor does it match the empty substring at the end of the previous separator match. (For example, if the regular expression matches the empty String, the String is split up into individual code unit elements; the length of the result array equals the length of the String, and each substring contains one code unit.) Only the first match at a given index of the String is considered, even if backtracking could yield a non-empty substring match at that index. (For example, `/a*?/[Symbol.split](\"ab\")` evaluates to the array `[\"a\", \"b\"]`, while `/a*/[Symbol.split](\"ab\")` evaluates to the array `[\"\",\"b\"]`.)\n\nIf string is (or converts to) the empty String, the result depends on whether the regular expression can match the empty String. If it can, the result array contains no elements. Otherwise, the result array contains one element, which is the empty String.\n\nIf the regular expression contains capturing parentheses, then each time separator is matched the results (including any undefined results) of the capturing parentheses are spliced into the output array.

The [sort order] is [implementation-defined] if SortCompare is not a [consistent comparator] for the elements of items. When SortIndexedProperties is invoked by [Array.prototype.sort] or [Array.prototype.toSorted], the [sort order] is also [implementation-defined] if comparator is undefined, and all applications of [ToString], to any specific value passed as an argument to SortCompare, do not produce the same result.\n\nUnless the [sort order] is specified to be [implementation-defined], it must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n* There must be some mathematical permutation π of the non-negative [integers] less than itemCount, such that for every non-negative [integer] j less than itemCount, the element old\\[j\\] is exactly the same as new\\[π(j)\\].\n* Then for all non-negative [integers] j and k, each less than itemCount, if [ℝ](SortCompare(old\\[j\\], old\\[k\\])) < 0, then π(j) < π(k).\n* And for all non-negative [integers] j and k such that j < k < itemCount, if [ℝ](SortCompare(old\\[j\\], old\\[k\\])) = 0, then π(j) < π(k); i.e., the sort is stable.\n\nHere the notation old\\[j\\] is used to refer to items\\[j\\] before step [4] is executed, and the notation new\\[j\\] to refer to items\\[j\\] after step [4] has been executed.\n\nAn abstract closure or function comparator is a consistent comparator for a set of values S if all of the requirements below are met for all values a, b, and c (possibly the same value) in the set S: The notation a <C b means [ℝ](comparator(a, b)) < 0; a =C b means [ℝ](comparator(a, b)) = 0; and a >C b means [ℝ](comparator(a, b)) \\> 0.\n\n* Calling comparator(a, b) always returns the same value v when given a specific pair of values a and b as its two arguments. Furthermore, v [is a Number], and v is not NaN. Note that this implies that exactly one of a <C b, a =C b, and a >C b will be true for a given pair of a and b.\n* Calling comparator(a, b) does not modify obj or any object on obj's prototype chain.\n* a =C a (reflexivity)\n* If a =C b, then b =C a (symmetry)\n* If a =C b and b =C c, then a =C c (transitivity of =C)\n* If a <C b and b <C c, then a <C c (transitivity of <C)\n* If a >C b and b >C c, then a >C c (transitivity of >C)\n\nNote\n\nThe above conditions are necessary and sufficient to ensure that comparator divides the set S into equivalence classes and that these equivalence classes are totally ordered."}

In certain conditions, values which are not [live] are removed as WeakMap keys, as described in [9.9.3].\n\nAn implementation may impose an arbitrarily determined latency between the time a key/value pair of a WeakMap becomes inaccessible and the time when the key/value pair is removed from the WeakMap. If this latency was observable to ECMAScript program, it would be a source of indeterminacy that could impact program execution. For that reason, an ECMAScript implementation must not provide any means to observe a key of a WeakMap that does not require the observer to present the observed key.\n\nWeakMaps must be implemented using either hash tables or other mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of key/value pairs in the collection. The data structure used in this specification is only intended to describe the required observable semantics of WeakMaps. It is not intended to be a viable implementation model.\n\nNote\n\nWeakMap and WeakSet are intended to provide mechanisms for dynamically associating state with an object or symbol in a manner that does not “leak” memory resources if, in the absence of the WeakMap or WeakSet instance, the object or symbol otherwise became inaccessible and subject to resource reclamation by the implementation's garbage collection mechanisms. This characteristic can be achieved by using an inverted per-object/symbol mapping of WeakMap or WeakSet instances to keys. Alternatively, each WeakMap or WeakSet instance may internally store its key and value data, but this approach requires coordination between the WeakMap or WeakSet implementation and the garbage collector.

The amount of available physical memory differ greatly between hardware devices. Similarly, virtual memory subsystems also differ greatly between hardware devices as well as operating systems. An application that runs without out-of-memory errors on a 64-bit desktop web browser could run out of memory on a 32-bit mobile web browser.\n\nWhen choosing a value for the \"maxByteLength\" option for [growable SharedArrayBuffer], we recommend that the smallest possible size for the application be chosen. We recommend that \"maxByteLength\" does not exceed 1073741824, or 1GiB.\n\nPlease note that successfully constructing a [growable SharedArrayBuffer] for a particular maximum size does not guarantee that future grows will succeed.\n\nNot all loads of a [growable SharedArrayBuffer]'s length are synchronizing seq-cst loads. Loads of the length that are for bounds-checking of an [integer-indexed] property access, e.g. `u8[idx]`, are not synchronizing. In general, in the absence of explicit synchronization, one property access being in-bound does not imply a subsequent property access in the same [agent] is also in-bound. In contrast, explicit loads of the length via the `length` and `byteLength` getters on SharedArrayBuffer, [%TypedArray%].prototype, and DataView.prototype are synchronizing. Loads of the length that are performed by built-in methods to check if a [TypedArray] is entirely out-of-bounds are also synchronizing.\n\nNote 2\n\nThe following are guidelines for ECMAScript implementers implementing [growable SharedArrayBuffer].\n\nWe recommend [growable SharedArrayBuffer] be implemented as in-place growth via reserving virtual memory up front.\n\nBecause grow operations can happen in parallel with memory accesses on a [growable SharedArrayBuffer], the constraints of the [memory model] require that even unordered accesses do not \"tear\" (bits of their values will not be mixed). In practice, this means the underlying data block of a [growable SharedArrayBuffer] cannot be grown by being copied without stopping the world. We do not recommend stopping the world as an implementation strategy because it introduces a serialization point and is slow.\n\nGrown memory must appear zeroed from the moment of its creation, including to any racy accesses in parallel. This can be accomplished via zero-filled-on-demand virtual memory pages, or careful synchronization if manually zeroing memory.\n\n[Integer-indexed] property access on [TypedArray] views of growable SharedArrayBuffers is intended to be optimizable similarly to access on [TypedArray] views of non-growable SharedArrayBuffers, because [integer-indexed] property loads on are not synchronizing on the underlying buffer's length (see programmer guidelines above). For example, bounds checks for property accesses may still be hoisted out of loops.\n\nIn practice it is difficult to implement [growable SharedArrayBuffer] by copying on [hosts] that do not have virtual memory, such as those running on embedded devices without an MMU. Memory usage behaviour of growable SharedArrayBuffers on such [hosts] may significantly differ from that of [hosts] with virtual memory.

Returning from the executor function does not mean that the deferred action has been completed but only that the request to eventually perform the deferred action has been accepted.\n\nThe resolve function that is passed to an executor function accepts a single argument. The executor code may eventually call the resolve function to indicate that it wishes to resolve the associated Promise. The argument passed to the resolve function represents the eventual value of the deferred action and can be either the actual fulfillment value or another promise which will provide the value if it is fulfilled.\n\nThe reject function that is passed to an executor function accepts a single argument. The executor code may eventually call the reject function to indicate that the associated Promise is rejected and will never be fulfilled. The argument passed to the reject function is used as the rejection value of the promise.

When the program has no data races (defined below), the ordering of events appears as sequentially consistent, i.e., as an interleaving of actions from each [agent]. When the program has data races, shared memory operations may appear sequentially inconsistent. For example, programs may exhibit causality-violating behaviour and other astonishments. These astonishments arise from compiler transforms and the design of CPUs (e.g., out-of-order execution and speculation). The memory model defines both the precise conditions under which a program exhibits sequentially consistent behaviour as well as the possible values read from data races. To wit, there is no undefined behaviour.\n\nThe memory model is defined as relational constraints on events introduced by [abstract operations] on SharedArrayBuffer or by methods on the Atomics object during an evaluation.\n\nNote\n\nThis section provides an axiomatic model on events introduced by the [abstract operations] on SharedArrayBuffers. It bears stressing that the model is not expressible algorithmically, unlike the rest of this specification. The nondeterministic introduction of events by [abstract operations] is the interface between the operational semantics of ECMAScript evaluation and the axiomatic semantics of the memory model. The semantics of these events is defined by considering graphs of all events in an evaluation. These are neither Static Semantics nor Runtime Semantics. There is no demonstrated algorithmic implementation, but instead a set of constraints that determine if a particular event graph is allowed or disallowed."}

{"instruction": "29.11 Shared Memory Guidelines", "input": "", "output": "Note 1\n\nThe following are guidelines for ECMAScript programmers working with shared memory.\n\nWe recommend programs be kept [data race free], i.e., make it so that it is impossible for there to be concurrent non-atomic operations on the same memory location. [Data race free] programs have interleaving semantics where each step in the evaluation semantics of each [agent] are interleaved with each other. For [data race free] programs, it is not necessary to understand the details of the [memory model]. The details are unlikely to build intuition that will help one to better write ECMAScript.\n\nMore generally, even if a program is not [data race free] it may have predictable behaviour, so long as atomic operations are not involved in any data races and the operations that race all have the same access size. The simplest way to arrange for atomics not to be involved in races is to ensure that different memory cells are used by atomic and non-atomic operations and that atomic accesses of different sizes are not used to access the same cells at the same time. Effectively, the program should treat shared memory as strongly typed as much as possible. One still cannot depend on the ordering and timing of non-atomic accesses that race, but if memory is treated as strongly typed the racing accesses will not \"tear\" (bits of their values will not be mixed).\n\nNote 2\n\nThe following are guidelines for ECMAScript implementers writing compiler transformations for programs using shared memory.\n\nIt is desirable to allow most program transformations that are valid in a single-[agent] setting in a multi-[agent] setting, to ensure that the performance of each [agent] in a multi-[agent] program is as good as it would be in a single-[agent] setting. Frequently these transformations are hard to judge. We outline some rules about program transformations that are intended to be taken as normative (in that they are implied by the [memory model] or stronger than what the [memory model] implies) but which are likely not exhaustive. These rules are intended to apply to program transformations that precede the introductions of the events that make up the [is-agent-order-before] [Relation].\n\nLet an agent-order slice be the subset of the [is-agent-order-before] [Relation] pertaining to a single [agent].\n\nLet possible read values of a read event be the set of all values of [ValueOfReadEvent] for that event across all valid executions.\n\nAny transformation of an agent-order slice that is valid in the absence of shared memory is valid in the presence of shared memory, with the following exceptions.\n\n* _Atomics are carved in stone_: Program transformations must not cause the seq-cst events in an agent-order slice to be reordered with its unordered operations, nor its seq-cst operations to be reordered with each other, nor may a program transformation remove a seq-cst operation from the [is-agent-order-before] [Relation].\n    \n    (In practice, the prohibition on reorderings forces a compiler to assume that every seq-cst operation is a synchronization and included in the final [is-memory-order-before] [Relation], which it would usually have to assume anyway in the absence of inter-[agent] program analysis. It also forces the compiler to assume that every call where the callee's effects on the memory-order are unknown may contain seq-cst operations.)\n    \n* _Reads must be stable_: Any given shared memory read must only observe a single value in an execution.\n    \n    (For example, if what is semantically a single read in the program is executed multiple times then the program is subsequently allowed to observe only one of the values read. A transformation known as rematerialization can violate this rule.)\n    \n* _Writes must be stable_: All observable writes to shared memory must follow from program semantics in an execution.\n    \n    (For example, a transformation may not introduce certain observable writes, such as by using read-modify-write operations on a larger location to write a smaller datum, writing a value to memory that the program could not have written, or writing a just-read value back to the location it was read from, if that location could have been overwritten by another [agent] after the read.)\n    \n* _Possible read values must be non-empty_: Program transformations cannot cause the possible read values of a shared memory read to become empty.\n    \n    (Counterintuitively, this rule in effect restricts transformations on writes, because writes have force in [memory model] insofar as to be read by read events. For example, writes may be moved and coalesced and sometimes reordered between two seq-cst operations, but the transformation may not remove every write that updates a location; some write must be preserved.)\n    \n\nExamples of transformations that remain valid are: merging multiple non-atomic reads from the same location, reordering non-atomic reads, introducing speculative non-atomic reads, merging multiple non-atomic writes to the same location, reordering non-atomic writes to different locations, and hoisting non-atomic reads out of loops even if that affects termination. Note in general that aliased [TypedArrays] make it hard to prove that locations are different.\n\nNote 3\n\nThe following are guidelines for ECMAScript implementers generating machine code for shared memory accesses.\n\nFor architectures with memory models no weaker than those of ARM or Power, non-atomic stores and loads may be compiled to bare stores and loads on the target architecture. Atomic stores and loads may be compiled down to instructions that guarantee sequential consistency. If no such instructions exist, memory barriers are to be employed, such as placing barriers on both sides of a bare store or load. Read-modify-write operations may be compiled to read-modify-write instructions on the target architecture, such as `LOCK`-prefixed instructions on x86, load-exclusive/store-exclusive instructions on ARM, and load-link/store-conditional instructions on Power.\n\nSpecifically, the [memory model] is intended to allow code generation as follows.\n\n* Every atomic operation in the program is assumed to be necessary.\n* Atomic operations are never rearranged with each other or with non-atomic operations.\n* Functions are always assumed to perform atomic operations.\n* Atomic operations are never implemented as read-modify-write operations on larger data, but as non-lock-free atomics if the platform does not have atomic operations of the appropriate size. (We already assume that every platform has normal memory access operations of every interesting size.)\n\nNaive code generation uses these patterns:\n\n* Regular loads and stores compile to single load and store instructions.\n* Lock-free atomic loads and stores compile to a full (sequentially consistent) fence, a regular load or store, and a full fence.\n* Lock-free atomic read-modify-write accesses compile to a full fence, an atomic read-modify-write instruction sequence, and a full fence.\n* Non-lock-free atomics compile to a spinlock acquire, a full fence, a series of non-atomic load and store instructions, a full fence, and a spinlock release.\n\nThat mapping is correct so long as an atomic operation on an address range does not race with a non-atomic write or with an atomic operation of different size. However, that is all we need: the [memory model] effectively demotes the atomic operations involved in a race to non-atomic status. On the other hand, the naive mapping is quite strong: it allows atomic operations to be used as sequentially consistent fences, which the [memory model] does not actually guarantee.\n\nLocal improvements to those basic patterns are also allowed, subject to the constraints of the [memory model]. For example:\n\n* There are obvious platform-dependent improvements that remove redundant fences. For example, on x86 the fences around lock-free atomic loads and stores can always be omitted except for the fence following a store, and no fence is needed for lock-free read-modify-write instructions, as these all use `LOCK`-prefixed instructions. On many platforms there are fences of several strengths, and weaker fences can be used in certain contexts without destroying sequential consistency.\n* Most modern platforms support lock-free atomics for all the data sizes required by ECMAScript atomics. Should non-lock-free atomics be needed, the fences surrounding the body of the atomic operation can usually be folded into the lock and unlock steps. The simplest solution for non-lock-free atomics is to have a single lock word per SharedArrayBuffer.\n* There are also more complicated platform-dependent local improvements, requiring some code analysis. For example, two back-to-back fences often have the same effect as a single fence, so if code is generated for two atomic operations in sequence, only a single fence need separate them. On x86, even a single fence separating atomic stores can be omitted, as the fence following a store is only needed to separate the store from a subsequent load."}

The specifications in this annex define the requirements for interoperable implementations of these legacy features.\n\nThese features are not considered part of the core ECMAScript language. Programmers should not use or assume the existence of these features and behaviours when writing new ECMAScript code. ECMAScript implementations are discouraged from implementing these features unless the implementation is part of a web browser or is required to run the same legacy ECMAScript code that web browsers encounter."}

{"instruction": "B.3.2 Block-Level Function Declarations Web Legacy Compatibility Semantics", "input": "", "output": "Prior to ECMAScript 2015, the ECMAScript specification did not define the occurrence of a [FunctionDeclaration] as an element of a [Block] statement's [StatementList]. However, support for that form of [FunctionDeclaration] was an allowable extension and most browser-hosted ECMAScript implementations permitted them. Unfortunately, the semantics of such declarations differ among those implementations. Because of these semantic differences, existing web [ECMAScript source text] that uses [Block] level function declarations is only portable among browser implementations if the usage only depends upon the semantic intersection of all of the browser implementations for such declarations. The following are the use cases that fall within that intersection semantics:\n\n1.  A function is declared and only referenced within a single block.\n    \n    * One or more [FunctionDeclaration]s whose [BindingIdentifier] is the name f occur within the function code of an enclosing function g and that declaration is nested within a [Block].\n    * No other declaration of f that is not a `var` declaration occurs within the function code of g.\n    * All occurrences of f as an [IdentifierReference] are within the [StatementList] of the [Block] containing the declaration of f.\n2.  A function is declared and possibly used within a single [Block] but also referenced by an inner function definition that is not contained within that same [Block].\n    \n    * One or more [FunctionDeclaration]s whose [BindingIdentifier] is the name f occur within the function code of an enclosing function g and that declaration is nested within a [Block].\n    * No other declaration of f that is not a `var` declaration occurs within the function code of g.\n    * There may be occurrences of f as an [IdentifierReference] within the [StatementList] of the [Block] containing the declaration of f.\n    * There is at least one occurrence of f as an [IdentifierReference] within another function h that is nested within g and no other declaration of f shadows the references to f from within h.\n    * All invocations of h occur after the declaration of f has been evaluated.\n3.  A function is declared and possibly used within a single block but also referenced within subsequent blocks.\n    \n    * One or more [FunctionDeclaration] whose [BindingIdentifier] is the name f occur within the function code of an enclosing function g and that declaration is nested within a [Block].\n    * No other declaration of f that is not a `var` declaration occurs within the function code of g.\n    * There may be occurrences of f as an [IdentifierReference] within the [StatementList] of the [Block] containing the declaration of f.\n    * There is at least one occurrence of f as an [IdentifierReference] within the function code of g that lexically follows the [Block] containing the declaration of f.\n\nThe first use case is interoperable with the semantics of [Block] level function declarations provided by ECMAScript 2015. Any pre-existing [ECMAScript source text] that employs that use case will operate using the Block level function declarations semantics defined by clauses [10], [14], and [15].\n\nECMAScript 2015 interoperability for the second and third use cases requires the following extensions to the clause [10], clause [15], clause [19.2.1] and clause [16.1.7] semantics.\n\nIf an ECMAScript implementation has a mechanism for reporting diagnostic warning messages, a warning should be produced when code contains a [FunctionDeclaration] for which these compatibility semantics are applied and introduce observable differences from non-compatibility semantics. For example, if a var binding is not introduced because its introduction would create an [early error], a warning message should not be produced."}

A this value of either undefined or null is not converted to the [global object] and primitive values are not converted to wrapper objects. The this value passed via a function call (including calls made using `Function.prototype.apply` and `Function.prototype.call`) do not coerce the passed this value to an object ([10.2.1.2], [20.2.3.1], [20.2.3.3]).\n* When a `delete` operator occurs within [strict mode code], a SyntaxError is thrown if its [UnaryExpression] is a direct reference to a variable, function argument, or function name ([13.5.1.1]).\n* When a `delete` operator occurs within [strict mode code], a TypeError is thrown if the property to be deleted has the attribute { [Configurable]: false } or otherwise cannot be deleted ([13.5.1.2]).\n* [Strict mode code] may not include a [WithStatement]. The occurrence of a [WithStatement] in such a context is a SyntaxError ([14.11.1]).\n* It is a SyntaxError if a [CatchParameter] occurs within [strict mode code] and the [BoundNames] of [CatchParameter] contains either `eval` or `arguments` ([14.15.1]).\n* It is a SyntaxError if the same [BindingIdentifier] appears more than once in the [FormalParameters] of a [strict function]. An attempt to create such a function using a Function, Generator, or AsyncFunction [constructor] is a SyntaxError ([15.2.1], [20.2.1.1.1]).\n* An implementation may not extend, beyond that defined in this specification, the meanings within [strict functions] of properties named \"caller\" or \"arguments\" of function instances."}
